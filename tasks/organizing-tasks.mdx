## Using Tags

Tags are labels you can add to tasks to categorize and group them:

### What Are Tags?

Tags are flexible labels like:
- Project names: `acquisition-acme`, `q2-planning`
- Work types: `urgent`, `review-needed`, `documentation`
- Clients: `client-xyz`, `vendor-abc`
- Departments: `finance`, `hr`, `operations`
- Themes: `process-improvement`, `training`, `compliance`

</Note>

### Adding Tags to Tasks

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Task">
    Click on any task to open its detail view.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Find Tags Section">
    Look for the **Tags**, **Labels**, or **Categories** section.

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/tasks/tags-section.png" alt="Tags section in task" />
    </Frame>

    <Note>
    **Placeholder**: Screenshot of tags section in task detail
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add New Tag">
    Click **Add Tag** or the **+** button.

    - Type to search existing tags
    - Or create a new tag by typing a new name

    <Tip>
    Use existing tags when possible to keep your tag system organized. Only create new tags when necessary.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select or Create Tag">
    - Click an existing tag to apply it
    - Or press Enter to create a new tag
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Multiple Tags">
    You can add multiple tags to one task.

    **Example**: A task might be tagged with `urgent`, `finance`, and `q2-planning`
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save">
    Tags are automatically saved when applied.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Tag Naming Conventions

Create a consistent tagging system:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use Lowercase">
    Tags should be lowercase for consistency:

    ‚úÖ **Good**: `urgent`, `high-priority`

    ‚ùå **Bad**: `URGENT`, `High-Priority`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Hyphens for Multi-Word Tags">
    Separate words with hyphens:

    ‚úÖ **Good**: `process-improvement`, `client-onboarding`

    ‚ùå **Bad**: `process improvement`, `client_onboarding`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Be Specific but Not Too Specific">
    Find the right level of granularity:

    ‚úÖ **Good**: `finance`, `hr-onboarding`, `q2-2025`

    ‚ùå **Too broad**: `stuff`, `work`, `tasks`

    ‚ùå **Too specific**: `sarah-john-meeting-may-15-follow-up`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Create Tag Categories">
    Organize tags into categories:

    **Project Tags**: `project-alpha`, `project-beta`

    **Status Tags**: `blocked`, `waiting-approval`, `in-review`

    **Work Type Tags**: `meeting-prep`, `documentation`, `analysis`

    **Department Tags**: `finance`, `hr`, `operations`
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Filtering by Tags

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to My Tasks">
    Navigate to your task list.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click Filter">
    Open the filter panel.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Tags">
    Choose one or more tags to filter by:

    - Select `urgent` to see all urgent tasks
    - Select `finance` AND `urgent` to see urgent finance tasks
  </Step>

  <Step title="View Filtered List">
    Only tasks with selected tags display.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Clear Filters">
    Remove tag filters to see all tasks again.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Save commonly used tag filters as presets for quick access. For example, create a "My Urgent Work" preset that filters for tags you use regularly.
</Tip>

## Priority Levels

Priorities indicate how important and urgent tasks are:

### Understanding Priority Levels

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="High Priority" icon="circle-exclamation">
    **Red Badge**

    - Critical deadlines
    - Blocking other work
    - Executive requests
    - Time-sensitive issues

    Do these FIRST
  </Card>

  <Card title="Medium Priority" icon="circle">
    **Orange Badge**

    - Standard work
    - Normal deadlines
    - Regular responsibilities
    - Planned tasks

    Do these AFTER high priority
  </Card>

  <Card title="Low Priority" icon="circle">
    **Gray Badge**

    - Nice-to-have items
    - Future planning
    - Optional improvements
    - Fill-in work

    Do these WHEN TIME ALLOWS
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Setting Task Priority

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Task">
    Click on the task you want to prioritize.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Find Priority Setting">
    Look for the **Priority** dropdown or selector.

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/tasks/priority-selector.png" alt="Priority dropdown" />
    </Frame>

    <Note>
    **Placeholder**: Screenshot of priority selector
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose Priority Level">
    Select High, Medium, or Low based on:

    - **Urgency**: How soon must this be done?
    - **Importance**: How critical is this task?
    - **Impact**: What happens if delayed?
    - **Dependencies**: Are others waiting on this?
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save Changes">
    Priority is saved automatically or when you click Save.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Priority Decision Matrix

Use this matrix to decide priority:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/tasks/priority-decision-matrix.png" alt="Priority decision matrix" />
</Frame>

<Note>
**Placeholder**: Visual matrix showing Urgent vs Important quadrants
</Note>

| Urgent? | Important? | Priority |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| Yes | Yes | **High** - Do immediately |
| Yes | No | **Medium** - Schedule soon |
| No | Yes | **Medium** - Plan and execute |
| No | No | **Low** - Do when time allows |

<Warning>
If you mark too many tasks as High Priority, the priority system loses meaning. Reserve High Priority for truly urgent, critical work (10-20% of tasks).
</Warning>

### Changing Priority

Priorities can change as circumstances evolve:

<Accordion title="When to Increase Priority">
  - Deadline moved up
  - Situation became urgent
  - Someone is blocked waiting for this
  - Management escalated it
  - External deadline appeared

  Add a comment explaining why priority increased.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="When to Decrease Priority">
  - Deadline extended
  - Other work became more urgent
  - Dependencies delayed
  - Scope reduced

  Add a comment explaining the change.
</Accordion>

## Due Date Management

Due dates help you plan work and meet deadlines:

### Setting Due Dates

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Task">
    Click on the task.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click Due Date Field">
    Find the **Due Date** field and click it.

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/tasks/due-date-picker.png" alt="Due date calendar picker" />
    </Frame>

    <Note>
    **Placeholder**: Screenshot of date picker calendar
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Date">
    Choose the date from the calendar.

    Some systems also let you set a specific time.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save">
    Due date is saved when you select it.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Due Date Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Set Realistic Dates">
    Give yourself enough time to do quality work:

    - **Quick tasks** (< 30 min): Same day or next day
    - **Standard tasks** (1-3 hours): 2-3 days
    - **Complex tasks** (> 1 day): 1+ week

    Account for your existing workload.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Buffer Time">
    Set due dates earlier than when you actually need completion:

    - Allows for unexpected issues
    - Reduces stress
    - Provides time for review
    - Accounts for dependencies

    **Example**: If you need something by Friday, set due date for Wednesday.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Coordinate with Dependencies">
    If tasks depend on each other, set due dates in logical order:

    - Task A (due Monday) ‚Üí Task B (due Wednesday) ‚Üí Task C (due Friday)

    Don't set Task C's due date before Task B can be completed.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Review and Adjust">
    Regularly review due dates:

    - Move dates if circumstances change
    - Extend if you're blocked
    - Communicate changes to stakeholders

    Don't let tasks become overdue silently.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Due Date Alerts

Visual indicators help you spot upcoming deadlines:

| Indicator | Meaning | Action |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| üî¥ **Red** | Overdue | Work on immediately |
| üü† **Orange** | Due today | Complete today |
| üü° **Yellow** | Due this week | Plan to complete soon |
| ‚ö™ **Gray** | Future or no due date | Normal priority |

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/tasks/due-date-colors.png" alt="Due date color indicators" />
</Frame>

<Note>
**Placeholder**: Screenshot showing tasks with different due date colors
</Note>

### Example: Organized Task

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/tasks/fully-organized-task.png" alt="Task with all organization features" />
</Frame>

<Note>
**Placeholder**: Screenshot showing a task with tags, priority, due date, and category
</Note>

**Task**: Review Q2 financial report

**Organization:**
- **Priority**: High (needed for board meeting)
- **Due Date**: Friday, June 14
- **Category**: Finance
- **Tags**: `q2-2025`, `board-meeting`, `urgent`, `review-needed`
- **Workflow**: Quarterly Board Reporting

This task can be found by:
- Filtering for high priority
- Filtering for due this week
- Filtering for Finance category
- Searching for `q2-2025` tag
- Viewing the Quarterly Board Reporting workflow

### Common Organization Patterns

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="The Daily Focus View">
    **Filters:**
    - Due Date: Today
    - Status: Available or In Progress
    - Sorted by: Priority (High first)

    **Result**: Shows exactly what you should work on today, most urgent first.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="The Weekly Planning View">
    **Filters:**
    - Due Date: This week
    - Priority: High or Medium
    - Grouped by: Category

    **Result**: Shows this week's work organized by project/area.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="The Project View">
    **Filters:**
    - Category: Specific project
    - Status: Not completed
    - Sorted by: Due date

    **Result**: All tasks for one project in chronological order.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="The Quick Wins View">
    **Filters:**
    - Status: Available
    - Estimated time: < 30 minutes
    - Sorted by: Due date

    **Result**: Quick tasks you can knock out when you have spare time.
  </Accordion>

    **Filters:**
    - Status: Blocked
    - Sorted by: Priority

    **Result**: All blocked tasks needing intervention, most urgent first.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices for Task Organization

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Develop a Consistent System">
    Create and stick to a tagging and categorization system:

    - Define your tag categories upfront
    - Document what each tag means
    - Use tags consistently
    - Train your team on the system

    Consistency makes organization useful.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Review and Reorganize Weekly">
    Set aside time each week to:

    - Review all your tasks
    - Update priorities
    - Adjust due dates
    - Add missing tags
    - Remove irrelevant tags
    - Archive completed tasks

    Weekly reviews keep your system clean.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Don't Over-Organize">
    Organization is a tool, not a goal:

    - Don't spend hours tagging tasks
    - Don't create 50 different tags
    - Don't over-categorize simple tasks

    If organizing takes more time than doing the work, you're over-organizing.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Saved Views/Filters">
    Create saved filters for common views:

    - Save "Today's Work" filter
    - Save "This Week" filter
    - Save "Project Alpha" filter

    Quick access to common views saves time daily.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Prioritize Ruthlessly">
    Not everything can be high priority:

    - Be honest about what's urgent
    - Learn to say no or delegate
    - Focus on impact, not just activity
    - Communicate priorities with stakeholders

    If everything is important, nothing is.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Advanced Organization Techniques

### Custom Fields

Some systems allow custom fields for specialized organization:

<Accordion title="Creating Custom Fields">
  Add fields like:
  - **Client Name**: Track tasks by client
  - **Estimated Hours**: Plan your capacity
  - **Phase**: Track project phases
  - **Review Status**: Track review stages

  Use custom fields to capture information important to your work.
</Accordion>

### Task Dependencies

Link related tasks to show relationships:

<Accordion title="Setting Dependencies">
  Mark that Task B depends on Task A:
  - Task B can't start until Task A completes
  - Visual connection shown between tasks
  - Automatic status updates

  Dependencies help prevent working on tasks before you're ready.
</Accordion>

### Recurring Tasks

Set up tasks that repeat automatically:

<Accordion title="Creating Recurring Tasks">
  For regular responsibilities:
  - Weekly team meeting prep
  - Monthly report submission
  - Quarterly reviews
  - Annual compliance tasks

  Set once, automatically recreates on schedule.
</Accordion>

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

    5. Consider what can be delegated
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Tasks Keep Becoming Overdue">
    **Solutions:**

    1. Set more realistic due dates
    2. Add buffer time to estimates
    3. Review and adjust workload
