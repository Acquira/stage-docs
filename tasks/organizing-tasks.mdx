## Using Tags

Tags are flexible labels you can add to tasks to categorize and group them.

### What Are Tags?

Tags are flexible labels like:
- Project names: `acquisition-acme`, `q2-planning`
- Work types: `urgent`, `review-needed`, `documentation`
- Clients: `client-xyz`, `vendor-abc`
- Departments: `finance`, `hr`, `operations`
- Themes: `process-improvement`, `training`, `compliance`

### Adding Tags to Tasks

You can add tags when creating a task or by editing it.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Task">
    Navigate to **Tasks & Work > My Tasks** or **Team Tasks** and click "View" on a task, then click "Edit Task". Or, click **+ New Task**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Find Tags Section">
    Look for the **Tags** field in the task panel.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add New Tag">
    - Type to search existing tags
    - Or type a new name and press Enter to create a new tag
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Multiple Tags">
    You can add multiple tags to one task.

    **Example**: A task might be tagged with `urgent`, `finance`, and `q2-planning`
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save">
    Tags are saved when you "Create Task" or "Save Changes".
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Tag Naming Conventions

Create a consistent tagging system:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use Lowercase">
    Tags are automatically converted to lowercase.

    **Good**: `urgent`, `high-priority`

    **Bad**: `URGENT`, `High-Priority`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Hyphens for Multi-Word Tags">
    Separate words with hyphens:

    **Good**: `process-improvement`, `client-onboarding`

    **Bad**: `process improvement`, `client_onboarding`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Be Specific but Not Too Specific">
    Find the right level of granularity:

    **Good**: `finance`, `hr-onboarding`, `q2-2025`

    **Bad** (Too broad): `stuff`, `work`, `tasks`

    **Bad** (Too specific): `sarah-john-meeting-may-15-follow-up`
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Priority Levels

Priorities indicate how important and urgent tasks are. This is a required field when creating a task.

### Understanding Priority Levels

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="High Priority" icon="circle-exclamation">
    - Critical deadlines
    - Blocking other work
    - Executive requests
    - Time-sensitive issues

    Do these FIRST
  </Card>

  <Card title="Medium Priority" icon="circle">
    - Standard work
    - Normal deadlines
    - Regular responsibilities
    - Planned tasks

    Do these AFTER high priority
  </Card>

  <Card title="Low Priority" icon="circle">
    - Nice-to-have items
    - Future planning
    - Optional improvements
    - Fill-in work

    Do these WHEN TIME ALLOWS
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Setting Task Priority

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Task">
    Open the "Create New Task" or "Edit Task" panel.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Find Priority Setting">
    Look for the **Priority*** dropdown.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose Priority Level">
    Select High, Medium, or Low based on:

    - **Urgency**: How soon must this be done?
    - **Importance**: How critical is this task?
    - **Impact**: What happens if delayed?
    - **Dependencies**: Are others waiting on this?
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save Changes">
    Priority is saved when you click "Create Task" or "Save Changes".
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Priority Decision Matrix

Use this matrix to decide priority:

| Urgent? | Important? | Priority |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| Yes | Yes | **High** - Do immediately |
| Yes | No | **Medium** - Schedule soon |
| No | Yes | **Medium** - Plan and execute |
| No | No | **Low** - Do when time allows |

<Warning>
If you mark too many tasks as High Priority, the priority system loses meaning. Reserve High Priority for truly urgent, critical work (10-20% of tasks).
</Warning>

### Changing Priority

Priorities can change as circumstances evolve:

<Accordion title="When to Increase Priority">
  - Deadline moved up
  - Situation became urgent
  - Someone is blocked waiting for this
  - Management escalated it
  - External deadline appeared

  Add a comment explaining why priority increased.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="When to Decrease Priority">
  - Deadline extended
  - Other work became more urgent
  - Dependencies delayed
  - Scope reduced

  Add a comment explaining the change.
</Accordion>

## Due Date Management

Due dates help you plan work and meet deadlines:

### Setting Due Dates

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Task">
    Open the "Create New Task" or "Edit Task" panel.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click Due Date Field">
    Find the **Due Date** field and click it.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Date">
    Choose the date from the calendar.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save">
    Due date is saved when you "Create Task" or "Save Changes".
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Due Date Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Set Realistic Dates">
    Give yourself enough time to do quality work:

    - **Quick tasks** (< 30 min): Same day or next day
    - **Standard tasks** (1-3 hours): 2-3 days
    - **Complex tasks** (> 1 day): 1+ week

    Account for your existing workload.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Buffer Time">
    Set due dates earlier than when you actually need completion:

    - Allows for unexpected issues
    - Reduces stress
    - Provides time for review
    - Accounts for dependencies

    **Example**: If you need something by Friday, set due date for Wednesday.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Coordinate with Dependencies">
    If tasks depend on each other, set due dates in logical order:

    - Task A (due Monday) → Task B (due Wednesday) → Task C (due Friday)

    Don't set Task C's due date before Task B can be completed.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Review and Adjust">
    Regularly review due dates:

    - Move dates if circumstances change
    - Extend if you're blocked
    - Communicate changes to stakeholders

    Don't let tasks become overdue silently.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Combining Organization Methods

The most effective task organization uses multiple methods together:

### Example: Organized Task

**Task**: Review Q2 financial report

**Organization:**
- **Priority**: High (needed for board meeting)
- **Due Date**: Friday, June 14
- **Tags**: `q2-2025`, `board-meeting`, `urgent`, `review-needed`
- **Workflow**: Quarterly Board Reporting

This task can be found by:
- Filtering for high priority
- Filtering for due this week (using your own date range)
- Searching for `q2-2025` tag

### Common Organization Patterns

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="The Daily Focus View">
    **Filters:**
    - Due Date: Today (or this week)
    - Status: New or In Progress
    - Sorted by: Priority (High first)

    **Result**: Shows exactly what you should work on today, most urgent first.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="The Blocked Items View">
    **Filters:**
    - Status: Blocked
    - Sorted by: Priority

    **Result**: All blocked tasks needing intervention, most urgent first.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices for Task Organization

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Develop a Consistent System">
    Create and stick to a tagging system:

    - Define your tag categories upfront
    - Document what each tag means
    - Use tags consistently
    - Train your team on the system

    Consistency makes organization useful.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Review and Reorganize Weekly">
    Set aside time each week to:

    - Review all your tasks
    - Update priorities
    - Adjust due dates
    - Add missing tags
    - Remove irrelevant tags
    - Archive completed tasks

    Weekly reviews keep your system clean.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Don't Over-Organize">
    Organization is a tool, not a goal:

    - Don't spend hours tagging tasks
    - Don't create 50 different tags
    - Don't over-categorize simple tasks

    If organizing takes more time than doing the work, you're over-organizing.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Prioritize Ruthlessly">
    Not everything can be high priority:

    - Be honest about what's urgent
    - Learn to say no or delegate
    - Focus on impact, not just activity
    - Communicate priorities with stakeholders

    If everything is important, nothing is.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Too Many Tasks, Feeling Overwhelmed">
    **Solutions:**

    1. Filter to show only tasks due this week
    2. Delegate or reassign low-priority items
    3. Discuss workload with manager
    4. Focus on high-priority items first
    5. Break large tasks into smaller subtasks
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can't Find Specific Tasks">
    **Solutions:**

    1. Use search function with keywords
    2. Filter by status or priority
    3. Search by tags

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Everything Seems High Priority">
    **Solutions:**

    1. Review priorities with manager
    2. Re-prioritize based on actual urgency
    3. Communicate capacity constraints
    4. Negotiate deadlines
    5. Consider what can be delegated
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Tasks Keep Becoming Overdue">
    **Solutions:**

    1. Set more realistic due dates
    2. Add buffer time to estimates
    3. Review and adjust workload
    4. Address recurring blockers
    5. Communicate proactively about delays
