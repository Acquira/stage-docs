  </Step>
</Steps>

## Updating Task Status

Keep task status current so everyone knows what you're working on:

### Starting a Task

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click 'Start Task'">
    When you're ready to begin work, click the **Start Task** button.

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/tasks/start-task-action.png" alt="Start Task button" />
    </Frame>

    <Note>
    **Placeholder**: Screenshot showing Start Task button
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Status Updates to 'In Progress'">
    - Task status badge changes to "In Progress"
    - Task moves to your "In Progress" section
    - Team members see you're working on it
    - Time tracking begins (if enabled)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Notifications Sent">
    Relevant people are notified:
    - Workflow owner knows work has started
    - Team members waiting on this task get updates
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
Starting a task is optional but recommended. It provides visibility and prevents duplicate work when tasks are assigned to teams.
</Info>

### Pausing a Task

<Accordion title="If you need to pause work">
  If you start a task but can't complete it immediately:

  1. Add a comment explaining why you're pausing
  2. Task remains "In Progress"
  3. Come back to it when ready

  **Example comment**: "Pausing - waiting for vendor response. Will resume when they reply."

  The task stays in your "In Progress" list as a reminder.
</Accordion>

### Marking as Blocked

<Accordion title="If you encounter a blocker">
  If you cannot complete the task due to an issue:

  1. Click **Mark as Blocked**
  2. Add comment explaining the blocker
  3. Tag people who can help
  4. Status changes to "Blocked"

  **Example**:
  ```
  Marking as blocked - cannot access vendor portal to download contract.
  IT ticket #4567 submitted. @it-manager can you expedite?
  ```

  This alerts others that intervention is needed.
</Accordion>

## Adding Comments to Tasks

Comments provide context, ask questions, and document decisions:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Scroll to Comments Section">
    Find the comments area at the bottom of the task detail panel.

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/tasks/comments-section.png" alt="Task comments section" />

  </Step>

  <Step title="Click 'Add Comment'">
    Click in the comment text field to begin typing.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Write Your Comment">
    Add relevant information:

    **Good comments:**

    - "Changed approach per discussion with @manager - using Method B instead of Method A"
    - "Question: Should I include Q4 data in this report or just Q1-Q3? @project-owner"
    - "Completed successfully. Note: Had to use alternate vendor due to original being out of stock."

    **Avoid:**
    - "Done" (not helpful for future reference)
    - Comments that just repeat the task name
    - Vague updates without details
  </Step>

  <Step title="Tag People When Needed">
    Use **@mentions** to notify specific people:

    - Type `@` followed by the person's name
    - Select from the dropdown
    - They'll receive a notification

    **When to tag:**
    - Asking someone a question
    - Notifying someone of important information
    - Requesting approval or review
    - Escalating an issue
  </Step>

  <Step title="Format Your Comment">
    Use formatting for clarity:

    - **Bold** important points
    - Use bullet points for lists
    - Add line breaks for readability
    - Include links to resources

    <Tip>
    Many systems support Markdown formatting. Check your system's help docs for formatting options.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Post Comment">
    Click **Post** or **Add Comment** to publish.

    Comment appears in the task's activity stream with:

### Attachment Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Name Files Descriptively">
    Before uploading, rename files to be clear:

    ✅ **Good**: `signed-vendor-contract-acme-corp-2025.pdf`

    ❌ **Bad**: `document.pdf` or `scan001.pdf`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Upload Immediately">
    Don't wait until you mark the task complete. Upload files as you create or receive them.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Compress Large Files">
    If files are very large:
    - Compress PDFs
    - Resize images
    - Use ZIP files for multiple items
    - Or link to cloud storage instead
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Include All Required Evidence">
    Check task requirements. If it says "upload signed form AND confirmation email," make sure to upload both.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Marking a Task Complete

Once work is done and documented, mark the task complete:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Verify Completion Requirements">
    Before marking complete, confirm:

    ✅ Work is actually finished

  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Completion Notes (Optional)">
    Some systems prompt for final comments:

    - Summary of what was done
    - Any important outcomes
    - Information for next steps

    **Example**: "Completed onboarding call. Employee is excited and will start June 1st. Sent calendar invite for first day."
  </Step>

  <Step title="Confirm Completion">
    Click **Confirm** if prompted.

    Some systems require you to acknowledge:
    - Work is complete

  </Step>

  <Step title="Task Status Updates">
    Task is now complete:
    - Status changes to "Completed"

</Accordion>

## Tasks Requiring Approval

Some tasks need manager or stakeholder approval before completing:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Complete the Work">
    Do the task as normal.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Upload Evidence">
    Provide all required documentation.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Submit for Approval">
    Instead of "Mark Complete," click **Submit for Approval**.

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/tasks/submit-approval.png" alt="Submit for Approval button" />
    </Frame>

    <Note>
    **Placeholder**: Screenshot showing Submit for Approval option
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Task Goes to Approver">
    Status changes to "Pending Approval":
    - Approver receives notification
    - Task is locked from editing
    - You wait for approval decision
  </Step>

  <Step title="Approval or Rejection">
    Approver reviews your work and either:

    **Approved:**
    - Task moves to "Completed"
    - You receive notification
    - Workflow progresses

    **Rejected:**
    - Task returns to "In Progress"
    - Approver provides feedback
    - You make corrections and resubmit
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Responding to Rejection

If your task is rejected:

1. Read the approver's feedback carefully
2. Make the requested changes
3. Upload updated evidence if needed
4. Add a comment explaining what you changed
5. Resubmit for approval

**Example comment**: "Updated report per feedback - added Q4 data and corrected calculations on page 5. Resubmitting for approval."

## Editing Completed Tasks

Sometimes you need to update a task after marking it complete:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Adding Forgotten Evidence">
    If you forgot to upload something:

    1. Open the completed task
    2. Upload the missing file
    3. Add comment: "Adding missed attachment - [description]"

    The task remains complete but now has the full documentation.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Correcting Mistakes">
    If you realize you made an error:

    1. Add a comment explaining the mistake
    2. Tag the workflow owner or manager
    3. They can reopen the task for you
    4. Make corrections
    5. Re-mark as complete

    <Warning>
    Don't try to hide mistakes. It's better to correct them openly and maintain trust.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Updating Outdated Information">
    If information changed after completion:

    1. Add a comment with the update
    2. Upload revised documentation if needed

    **Example**: "Update: Start date changed from June 1 to June 15 per employee request. Uploading revised offer letter."
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Info>
Most systems don't allow editing completed tasks directly to maintain audit trails. Changes are made via comments and additional attachments.
</Info>

## Task Completion Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Complete Tasks Promptly">
    Don't let tasks linger in "In Progress":

    - Finish what you start
    - If you can't finish, add a comment explaining why
    - Update estimated completion time

    Stale "In Progress" tasks make it hard to track real progress.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Quality Over Speed">
    Taking time to do tasks correctly is better than rushing:

    - Double-check your work
    - Verify evidence is clear and complete
    - Ensure you followed instructions
    - Review before marking complete

    Rushing creates rework and erodes trust.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Document as You Go">
    Don't wait until the end to document:

    - Add comments throughout the process
    - Upload files as you create them
    - Capture decisions in real-time

    It's hard to remember details later.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Communicate Proactively">
    Keep stakeholders informed:

    - Add comments about challenges
    - Tag people when you need input
    - Update status regularly
    - Share important information

    Over-communication is better than under-communication.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Check Dependencies Before Completing">
    Before marking complete, verify:

    - You actually finished (not 95% done)
    - Evidence clearly proves completion
    - Quality meets standards
    - Any approvals are obtained

    Incomplete completions cause problems downstream.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Common Task Completion Scenarios

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Task Takes Longer Than Expected">
    **What to do:**

    1. Add a comment explaining the delay
    2. Update estimated completion date
    3. Notify affected people if delay impacts them
    4. Ask for help if you're stuck

    **Example comment**: "This task is taking longer than expected due to data quality issues. Need extra 2 days to clean data properly. Will complete by Thursday instead of Tuesday."
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Instructions Are Unclear">
    **What to do:**

    1. Add a comment asking for clarification
    2. Tag the task creator or workflow owner
    3. Don't proceed until you get clarity
    4. Don't guess - ask

    **Example comment**: "@workflow-owner The instructions say 'configure system settings' but don't specify which settings. Can you clarify which settings need to be configured?"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Resources Aren't Available">
    **What to do:**

    1. Mark task as blocked
    2. Explain what resources you need
    3. Tag people who can provide resources
    4. Document when you expect resources

    **Example comment**: "Marking as blocked - need access to vendor portal to complete this. Requested access from IT (ticket #4567). Expected access by tomorrow."
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="You Made a Mistake">
    **What to do:**

    1. Add a comment acknowledging the error
    2. Explain what happened
    3. Describe how you'll fix it
    4. Upload corrected work
    5. Notify affected people

    **Example comment**: "I made an error in the financial calculations. Discovered issue during review. Correcting now and will upload revised report within 1 hour. @manager FYI - doesn't affect deadline."

    Transparency maintains trust.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Task Is No Longer Needed">
    **What to do:**

    1. Add a comment explaining why
    2. Tag the workflow owner
    3. Ask if task should be cancelled
    4. Don't mark it complete if work wasn't done

    **Example comment**: "@workflow-owner This task is no longer needed because we decided to use the existing contract instead. Can you cancel this task?"
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
