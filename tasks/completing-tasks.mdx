</Steps>

## Opening a Task

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to the Task">
    Access tasks from multiple locations:

    **From My Tasks:**
    - Click **Tasks & Work > My Tasks** in the navigation sidebar
    - Find and click "View" on the task row

    **From a Workflow:**
    - Open the workflow

    **From a Notification:**
    - Click a task notification
    - Opens directly to the task
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review Task Information">
    Before starting, review the "Task Details" panel:

    - **Task Title** and **Description**: What needs to be done
    - **Priority** level: How urgent is this
    - **Status**: The current state (e.g., "New")
    - **Assigned To**: Who is responsible
    - **Due date**: When it should be completed
    - **Dependencies**: What must be done first
    - **Attachment requirements**: What documentation is needed
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Updating Task Status

Keep task status current so everyone knows what you're working on:

### Starting a Task

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click the 'Status' Dropdown">
    When you're ready to begin work, click the **Status** dropdown in the "Task Details" panel.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select 'In Progress'">
    - Task status badge changes to "In Progress"
    - Task moves to your "In Progress" section
    - Team members see you're working on it
    - Time tracking begins (if enabled)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Notifications Sent">
    Relevant people are notified:
    - Workflow owner knows work has started
    - Team members waiting on this task get updates
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
Starting a task is optional but recommended. It provides visibility and prevents duplicate work when tasks are assigned to teams.
</Info>

### Pausing a Task

<Accordion title="If you need to pause work">
  If you start a task but can't complete it immediately:

  1. Add a comment explaining why you're pausing
  2. Task remains "In Progress"
  3. Come back to it when ready

  **Example comment**: "Pausing - waiting for vendor response. Will resume when they reply."

  The task stays in your "In Progress" list as a reminder.
</Accordion>

### Marking as Blocked

<Accordion title="If you encounter a blocker">
  If you cannot complete the task due to an issue:

  1. Change the **Status** dropdown to "Blocked"
  2. Add a comment explaining the blocker
  3. Tag people who can help
  4. Status changes to "Blocked"

  **Example**:
Marking as blocked - cannot access vendor portal to download contract. IT ticket #4567 submitted. @it-manager can you expedite?


This alerts others that intervention is needed.
</Accordion>

## Adding Comments to Tasks

Comments provide context, ask questions, and document decisions:

<Steps>
<Step title="Scroll to Comments Section">
  Find the "Comments" area at the bottom of the "Task Details" panel (e.g., "Comments (0)").
</Step>

<Step title="Click 'Add Comment'">
  Click the **Add Comment** button.
</Step>

<Step title="Write Your Comment">
  Add relevant information:

  **Good comments:**
  - "Spoke with vendor - they confirmed delivery by Friday"
  - "Changed approach per discussion with @manager - using Method B instead of Method A"
  - "Question: Should I include Q4 data in this report or just Q1-Q3? @project-owner"
  - "Completed successfully. Note: Had to use alternate vendor due to original being out of stock."

  **Avoid:**
  - "Done" (not helpful for future reference)
  - Comments that just repeat the task name
  - Vague updates without details
</Step>

<Step title="Tag People When Needed">
  Use **@mentions** to notify specific people:

  - Type `@` followed by the person's name
  - Select from the dropdown
  - They'll receive a notification

  **When to tag:**
  - Asking someone a question
  - Notifying someone of important information
  - Requesting approval or review
  - Escalating an issue
</Step>

<Step title="Format Your Comment">
  Use formatting for clarity:

  - **Bold** important points
  - Use bullet points for lists
  - Add line breaks for readability
  - Include links to resources
</Step>

<Step title="Post Comment">
  Click **Post** or **Add Comment** to publish.

  Comment appears in the task's activity stream.

[See detailed guide on uploading evidence](/workflows/uploading-evidence)

### Attachment Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Name Files Descriptively">
  Before uploading, rename files to be clear:

  **Good**: `signed-vendor-contract-acme-corp-2025.pdf`

  **Bad**: `document.pdf` or `scan001.pdf`
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Upload Immediately">
  Don't wait until you mark the task complete. Upload files as you create or receive them.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Compress Large Files">
  If files are very large:
  - Compress PDFs
  - Resize images
  - Use ZIP files for multiple items
  - Or link to cloud storage instead
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Include All Required Attachments">
  Check task requirements. If it says "upload signed form AND confirmation email," make sure to upload both.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Marking a Task Complete

Once work is done and documented, mark the task complete:

<Steps>
<Step title="Verify Completion Requirements">
  Before marking complete, confirm:

  - Work is actually finished
  - All attachments/evidence uploaded
  - Required comments added
  - Quality standards met
  - Any approvals obtained (if needed)
</Step>

<Step title="Click the 'Status' Dropdown">
  In the "Task Details" panel, click the **Status** dropdown.
</Step>

<Step title="Select 'Completed'">
  Choose **"Completed"** from the list.
</Step>

<Step title="Add Completion Notes (Optional)">
  Add a final comment with a summary of what was done.

  **Example**: "Completed onboarding call. Employee is excited and will start June 1st. Sent calendar invite for first day."
</Step>

<Step title="Task Status Updates">
  Task is now complete:
  - Status changes to "Completed"
  - Task gets a checkmark in the list
  - Completion timestamp recorded
  - Task moves to completed tasks list
  - Dependent tasks may unlock
</Step>
</Steps>

### What Happens After Completion

<Accordion title="Notifications Sent">
People are notified of completion:
- Workflow owner sees progress
- Team members with dependent tasks are alerted
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Workflow Updates">
The workflow reflects your completion:
- Progress percentage increases
- Progress bar updates
- Task appears as complete in workflow view
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Dependent Tasks Unlock">
If other tasks were waiting on this one:
- They change from "Pending" to "New" or "Available"
- Assigned people can now start them
</Accordion>

## Tasks Requiring Approval

Some tasks need manager or stakeholder approval before completing:

<Steps>
<Step title="Complete the Work">
  Do the task as normal.
</Step>

<Step title="Upload Evidence">
  Provide all required documentation.
</Step>

<Step title="Submit for Approval">
  Instead of "Completed", change the **Status** dropdown to **"Pending Approval"**.
</Step>

<Step title="Task Goes to Approver">
  Status changes to "Pending Approval":
  - Approver receives notification
  - Task is locked from editing
  - You wait for approval decision
</Step>

<Step title="Approval or Rejection">
  Approver reviews your work and either:

  **Approved:**
  - Task status is changed to "Completed"
  - You receive notification
  - Workflow progresses

  **Rejected:**
  - Task status is changed back to "In Progress"
  - Approver provides feedback in the Comments
  - You make corrections and resubmit
</Step>
</Steps>

### Responding to Rejection

If your task is rejected:

1. Read the approver's feedback in the **Comments**
2. Make the requested changes
3. Upload updated evidence if needed
4. Add a comment explaining what you changed
5. Change the status back to **"Pending Approval"**

**Example comment**: "Updated report per feedback - added Q4 data and corrected calculations on page 5. Resubmitting for approval."

## Editing Completed Tasks

Sometimes you need to update a task after marking it complete:

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Adding Forgotten Attachments">
  If you forgot to upload something:

  1. Open the completed task
  2. Upload the missing file
  3. Add comment: "Adding missed attachment - [description]"

  The task remains complete but now has the full documentation.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Correcting Mistakes">
  If you realize you made an error:

  1. Add a comment explaining the mistake
  2. Tag the workflow owner or manager
  3. They can change the task status back to "In Progress"
  4. Make corrections
  5. Re-mark as "Completed"

  <Warning>
  Don't try to hide mistakes. It's better to correct them openly and maintain trust.
  </Warning>
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Info>
Most systems don't allow editing completed tasks directly to maintain audit trails. Changes are made via comments and additional attachments, or by reopening the task.
</Info>

## Task Completion Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Complete Tasks Promptly">
  Don't let tasks sit in "In Progress" for days. Complete them quickly to:
  - Unblock dependent tasks
  - Maintain workflow momentum
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Quality Over Speed">
  Taking time to do tasks correctly is better than rushing:
  - Double-check your work
  - Verify attachments are clear and complete
  - Ensure you followed instructions
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Document as You Go">
  Don't wait until the end to document:
  - Add comments throughout the process
  - Upload files as you create them
  - Capture decisions in real-time
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Communicate Proactively">
  Use comments to share:
  - Problems you encountered
  - Decisions you made
  - Information teammates will need
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Check Dependencies Before Completing">
  Before marking complete, verify:
  - You actually finished (not 95% done)
  - Attachments clearly prove completion
  - Quality meets standards
  - Any approvals are obtained
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Common Task Completion Scenarios

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Task Takes Longer Than Expected">
  **What to do:**

  1. Add a comment explaining the delay
  2. Update estimated completion date
  3. Notify affected people if delay impacts them

  **Example comment**: "This task is taking longer than expected due to data quality issues. Need extra 2 days to clean data properly. Will complete by Thursday instead of Tuesday."
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Instructions Are Unclear">
  **What to do:**

  1. Add a comment asking for clarification
  2. Tag the task creator or workflow owner
  3. Don't proceed until you get clarity
  4. Don't guess - ask

  **Example comment**: "@workflow-owner The instructions say 'configure system settings' but don't specify which settings. Can you clarify which settings need to be configured?"
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Resources Aren't Available">
  **What to do:**

  1. Change status to **Blocked**
  2. Explain what resources you need
  3. Tag people who can provide resources
  4. Document when you expect resources

  **Example comment**: "Marking as blocked - need access to vendor portal to complete this. Requested access from IT (ticket #4567). Expected access by tomorrow."
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Task Is No Longer Needed">
  **What to do:**

  1. Add a comment explaining why
  2. Tag the workflow owner
  3. Ask if task should be cancelled
  4. Don't mark it complete if work wasn't done

  **Example comment**: "@workflow-owner This task is no longer needed because we decided to use the existing contract instead. Can you cancel this task?"
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
