## When to Create Team Tasks

Create tasks for your team when:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Ad-Hoc Work" icon="bolt">
    Work that doesn't fit into an existing workflow but needs to be done
  </Card>

  <Card title="Follow-Up Items" icon="reply">
    Action items from meetings or discussions
  </Card>

  <Card title="Delegating Work" icon="hand">
    Work you need to delegate to specific team members
  </Card>

  <Card title="Project Tasks" icon="diagram-project">
    One-off project tasks that aren't part of a formal workflow
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Info>
If the work is part of a repeatable process, consider creating a workflow template instead of individual tasks.
</Info>

## Creating a New Task

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Tasks Section">
    Go to **Tasks** in the main navigation, then click **Create New Task**.

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/tasks/create-new-task-button.png" alt="Create New Task button" />
    </Frame>

    <Note>
    **Placeholder**: Screenshot showing Create New Task button location
    </Note>

    You may also be able to create tasks from:
    - Team member profile pages
    - Workflow views
    - Project dashboards
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter Task Name">
    Give the task a clear, action-oriented name:

    **Good task names:**
    - "Review Q2 financial report by Friday"
    - "Schedule team meeting for project kickoff"
    - "Update vendor contact information in system"

    **Bad task names:**
    - "Report" (too vague)
    - "Stuff to do" (not specific)
    - "Task 1" (not descriptive)

    Use action verbs: Review, Create, Update, Send, Schedule, Complete, Analyze, etc.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Write Task Description">
    Provide detailed instructions on what needs to be done:

    **Include:**
    - What needs to be done (specific actions)
    - Why it's important (context and purpose)
    - How to do it (instructions or guidance)
    - What to deliver (expected output)
    - Any relevant resources or links

    **Example:**
    ```
    Review the Q2 financial report for accuracy before the board meeting.

    WHY: Board meeting is Monday and they need accurate financials.

    WHAT TO CHECK:
    - All revenue numbers match bank deposits
    - Expense categorization is correct
    - No duplicate entries
    - Calculations are accurate

    DELIVER: Add a comment confirming review is complete and upload
    any corrections needed.

    RESOURCES: Financial report is in the Finance shared drive.
    ```

    <Tip>
    Write descriptions as if you're explaining the task to someone doing it for the first time.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Assign to Team Member">
    Choose who should complete this task:

    - **Specific Person**: Select an individual team member
    - **Role**: Assign to anyone with a specific role
    - **Team/Department**: Assign to a group
    - **Me**: Assign to yourself

    <Frame>

    </Frame>

    <Note>
    **Placeholder**: Screenshot of assignment selector
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Priority Level">
    Choose task priority:

    - **High**: Urgent and important - do first
    - **Medium**: Normal priority (default)
    - **Low**: Nice to have - do when time allows

    <Info>
    Use High priority sparingly. If everything is high priority, nothing is.
    </Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Due Date">
    When should this task be completed?

    - Select a specific date
    - Or leave blank for "no deadline"

    <Tip>
    Be realistic with due dates. It's better to give someone 3 days and have them finish early than give 1 day and have them miss the deadline.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Tags or Categories">
    Tag the task for organization:

    - Project name
    - Department
    - Work type
    - Client name

    **Examples**: `Q2-planning`, `urgent`, `finance`, `client-acme`

    Tags help people filter and find related tasks.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Specify Evidence Requirements">
    What documentation should be provided when complete?

    - Screenshots
    - Documents
    - Photos
    - Confirmation emails
    - Completed forms

    **Example**: "Upload screenshot of sent email confirmation and copy of signed form."
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create the Task">
    Click **Create Task** to save and assign it.

    The assignee receives a notification that they have a new task.

</Frame>

<Note>
**Placeholder**: Visual diagram showing priority matrix (Urgent vs Important)
</Note>

### High Priority

<Card title="Urgent + Important" icon="circle-exclamation">
  - Time-sensitive tasks
  - Blocking other work
  - Critical deadlines
  - Executive requests

  **Use sparingly** - Only 10-20% of tasks should be high priority.
</Card>

- "Fix production bug affecting customers"
- "Prepare board presentation for tomorrow's meeting"

### Medium Priority

<Card title="Important but Not Urgent" icon="circle">

<Warning>
If you find yourself marking everything as "High Priority," you're diluting the meaning of priority. Reserve High for truly urgent work.
</Warning>

## Setting Due Dates

Due dates help people prioritize and plan their work:

### Choosing Due Dates

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Consider Workload">
    Check the person's current task load before setting tight deadlines. If they have 10 high-priority tasks due this week, adding another might be unrealistic.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Be Realistic">
    Estimate how long the task actually takes, then add buffer time:

    - **Simple task** (15-30 min): Give same day or next day
    - **Standard task** (1-3 hours): Give 2-3 days
    - **Complex task** (1+ days): Give 1 week or more
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Consider Dependencies">
    If this task depends on other work, account for that in the due date. Don't set a due date before dependencies can be completed.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Account for Availability">
    Consider:
    - Holidays and weekends
    - Person's PTO or leave
    - Their meeting schedule
    - Other known commitments
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Communicate Urgency">
    If it's truly urgent, set a near due date AND mark priority as High. If it can wait, give more time.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Due Date Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Set Specific Dates" icon="calendar">
    Use specific dates like "June 15" rather than "ASAP" or "soon"
  </Card>

  <Card title="Include Time If Needed" icon="clock">
    For same-day tasks, specify time: "Today by 3 PM"
  </Card>

  <Card title="Build in Buffer" icon="shield">
    Set due date earlier than you absolutely need it
  </Card>

  <Card title="Align with Workflow" icon="diagram-project">
    Coordinate due dates with dependent tasks
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

  </Step>

  </Step>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Be Clear and Specific">
