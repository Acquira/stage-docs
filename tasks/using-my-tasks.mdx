## What is My Tasks?

"My Tasks" is your personal task dashboard that shows all tasks assigned to you across all workflows in one centralized list.

Instead of jumping between different workflows to find your work, "My Tasks" gives you a consolidated view of everything you need to do.

## Sorting Your Tasks

You can sort your task list by clicking on the column headers:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="By Due Date" icon="calendar">
    Click the "Due Date" header to see the soonest deadlines first.
  </Card>

  <Card title="By Priority" icon="exclamation">
    Click the "Priority" header to group tasks by urgency.
  </Card>

  <Card title="By Status" icon="signal">
    Click the "Status" header to group all your "New" tasks together.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Alphabetically" icon="arrow-down-a-z">
    Click the "Task" header to sort by name.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Info>
Most users prefer sorting by **Due Date** (ascending) or **Priority** (descending). This ensures urgent and important work appears at the top.
</Info>

## Task Priorities Explained

Priority levels help you decide what to work on first:

### High Priority

<Card title="Urgent and Important" icon="circle-exclamation">
  **Red Badge (or similar)**

  - Time-sensitive tasks
  - Critical path tasks
  - Tasks blocking others
  - Escalated issues

  **Action**: Do these first.
</Card>

### Medium Priority

<Card title="Important but Not Urgent" icon="circle">
  **Orange Badge (or similar)**

  - Normal workflow tasks
  - Standard deadlines
  - Regular responsibilities

  **Action**: Do these after high priority tasks.
</Card>

### Low Priority

<Card title="Nice to Have" icon="circle">
  **Gray/Green Badge (or similar)**

  - Optional improvements
  - Future planning
  - Non-urgent enhancements

  **Action**: Do these when you have extra time.
</Card>

## Understanding Due Dates

Due dates show when tasks should be completed:

| Due Date Status | Visual Indicator | Meaning |
|----------------|------------------|---------|
| **Overdue** | Red text + warning icon | Past due date - needs immediate attention |
| **Due Today** | Orange text + clock | Must complete today |
| **Due Soon** | Yellow text | Complete within next 7 days |
| **Due Later** | Normal text | More than a week away |
| **No Due Date** | Gray text or blank | Complete when possible |

<Warning>
Overdue tasks indicate either:
1. You're behind schedule (need to catch up)
2. Due dates are unrealistic (need to adjust timeline)
3. Task is blocked (need to resolve blocker)

Address overdue tasks immediately or escalate to your manager.
</Warning>

## Best Practices for Using My Tasks

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Make It Your Daily Starting Point">
    Start each workday by:
    1. Opening **My Tasks**
    2. Reviewing what's due today
    3. Checking for any overdue items
    4. Planning your day based on priorities
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Filters Strategically">
    Create filters for common scenarios:
    - "Today's work" - Status = New OR In Progress
    - "Urgent" - Overdue + Priority = High
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Update Status in Real-Time">
    As you work:
    - Change status to "In Progress" when you begin
    - Change status to "Completed" immediately when done
    - Change status to "Blocked" right away if you are stuck

    Real-time updates help the whole team.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Sort by Priority, Then Due Date">
    The best sorting strategy for most people:
    1. Primary sort: Priority (High → Low)
    2. Secondary sort: Due Date (Soonest → Latest)

    This ensures urgent AND important work rises to the top.
