## What is My Tasks?

My Tasks is your personal task dashboard that shows all tasks assigned to you across all workflows in one place.

Instead of jumping between workflows to find your work, My Tasks gives you a consolidated view of everything you need to do.

## Sorting Your Tasks

Change the order tasks appear in your list:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="By Due Date" icon="calendar">
    Soonest deadline first - helps prioritize urgent work
  </Card>

  <Card title="By Priority" icon="exclamation">
    High priority first - ensures critical tasks get attention
  </Card>

  <Card title="By Workflow" icon="diagram-project">
    Grouped by workflow - helps batch similar work
  </Card>

  <Card title="By Status" icon="signal">
    Available first, then In Progress, then Pending
  </Card>

  <Card title="By Date Added" icon="clock">
    Newest or oldest first
  </Card>

  <Card title="Alphabetically" icon="arrow-down-a-z">
    By task name A-Z or Z-A
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click Sort Button">
    Click the **Sort** dropdown at the top of your task list.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose Sort Method">
    Select how you want tasks ordered.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose Direction">
    - Ascending (A-Z, oldest first, lowest priority first)
    - Descending (Z-A, newest first, highest priority first)
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
Most users prefer sorting by **Due Date** (ascending) or **Priority** (descending). This ensures urgent and important work appears at the top.
</Info>

## Task Priorities Explained

Priority levels help you decide what to work on first:

### High Priority

<Card title="Urgent and Important" icon="circle-exclamation">
  **Red Badge**

  - Time-sensitive tasks
  - Critical path tasks
  - Tasks blocking others
  - Escalated issues

  **Action**: Do these first. High priority means drop other work if needed.
</Card>

### Medium Priority

<Card title="Important but Not Urgent" icon="circle">
  **Orange Badge**

  - Normal workflow tasks
  - Standard deadlines
  - Regular responsibilities

  **Action**: Do these after high priority tasks. This is most of your work.
</Card>

### Low Priority

<Card title="Nice to Have" icon="circle">
  **Gray Badge**

  - Optional improvements
  - Future planning
  - Non-urgent enhancements

  **Action**: Do these when you have extra time after high and medium tasks.
</Card>

<Tip>
If everything is marked "High Priority," nothing is truly high priority. Good priority management means most tasks are Medium, with only truly urgent items marked High.
</Tip>

## Understanding Due Dates

Due dates show when tasks should be completed:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/tasks/due-date-indicators.png" alt="Due date visual indicators" />
</Frame>

<Note>
**Placeholder**: Screenshot showing different due date color codes
</Note>

### Due Date Status

| Due Date Status | Visual Indicator | Meaning |
|----------------|------------------|---------|
| **Overdue** | Red text + warning icon | Past due date - needs immediate attention |
| **Due Today** | Orange text + clock | Must complete today |
| **Due This Week** | Yellow text | Complete within next 7 days |
| **Due Later** | Normal text | More than a week away |
| **No Due Date** | Gray text or blank | Complete when possible |

<Warning>
Overdue tasks indicate either:
1. You're behind schedule (need to catch up)
2. Due dates are unrealistic (need to adjust timeline)
3. Task is blocked (need to resolve blocker)

Address overdue tasks immediately or escalate to workflow owner.
</Warning>

## Best Practices for Using My Tasks

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Make It Your Daily Starting Point">
    Start each workday by:
    1. Opening My Tasks
    2. Reviewing what's due today
    3. Checking for any overdue items
    4. Planning your day based on priorities

    This gives you a clear picture of your day's work.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Filters Strategically">
    Create filters for common scenarios:
    - "Today's work" - Due today + Available/In Progress
    - "This week" - Due this week + High/Medium priority
    - "Urgent" - Overdue + High priority
    - "Quick wins" - Low duration + Available

    Switch between these views throughout your day.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Update Status in Real-Time">
    As you work:
    - Start tasks when you begin
    - Mark complete immediately when done
    - Update blocked status right away

    Don't batch updates at end of day. Real-time updates help the whole team.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Sort by Priority, Then Due Date">
    The best sorting strategy for most people:
    1. Primary sort: Priority (High → Low)
    2. Secondary sort: Due Date (Soonest → Latest)

    This ensures urgent AND important work rises to the top.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Set Aside Time for Task Management">
    Spend 10-15 minutes daily managing your tasks:
    - Morning: Review and plan
    - Midday: Quick check and updates
    - End of day: Mark completions and prep tomorrow

    This small investment prevents task chaos.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Tips for Managing Many Tasks

If you have dozens of tasks across multiple workflows:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Focus on This Week" icon="calendar-week">
    Filter to only show tasks due this week. Don't overwhelm yourself with everything.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Batch Similar Tasks" icon="layer-group">
    Group related tasks together and do them in one session for efficiency.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Time-Block Your Day" icon="clock">
    Assign specific time blocks to work on specific workflows or task types.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Use 'Available' Filter" icon="play-circle">
    When starting work, filter to only Available tasks. Ignore pending tasks you can't work on yet.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Mark Low Priority Realistically" icon="arrow-down">
    If you have too many high priority tasks, discuss with your manager about re-prioritizing.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Delegate When Possible" icon="hand">
    If you're overloaded, work with your manager to reassign some tasks.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>
