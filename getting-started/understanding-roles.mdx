## What Are User Roles?

User roles determine what you can do in the Business Process Framework. Your role defines your level of access and the actions you can take.

There are three roles: Owner, Admin, and Member. Each role builds on the previous one, giving you more capabilities as you move up.

## Member Role Explained

Members have read access to the processes shared with them. This is the most common role for regular team members.

**What Members Can Do**

**Who Should Be a Member**
- Most employees
- New hires

- Anyone who needs to reference processes but not create them

<Tip>
Being a Member doesn't mean you're less important! Most users are Members, and that's perfectly fine for accessing and using your organization's processes.
</Tip>

## Admin Role Explained

Admins can create, edit, and manage processes. They're the process owners and content managers.

**What Admins Can Do**
Everything Members can do, plus:
- Create new processes from scratch
- Edit any process they have access to
- Delete processes they created

- Process owners
- Team leads
- Training coordinators
- Anyone responsible for documenting procedures

<Info>
Admins are responsible for keeping processes accurate and up-to-date. If you're an Admin, make sure to review your processes regularly.
</Info>

## Owner Role Explained

Owners have complete control over the workspace. There's usually only one or two Owners per organization.

**What Owners Can Do**
Everything Admins can do, plus:
- Invite new team members
- Remove team members
- Change anyone's role
- Configure workspace settings
- Manage integrations
- Access all processes (even private ones)
- View usage analytics
- Manage billing and subscription
- Delete the workspace

**What Owners Should Be Careful About**
- Don't give Owner access to too many people
- Be cautious when deleting users or processes
- Review workspace settings before changing them
- Protect your login credentials carefully

**Who Should Be an Owner**
- Company executives
- IT administrators
- Business owners
- System managers

<Warning>
Owners have powerful privileges, including the ability to delete the entire workspace. Only assign this role to highly trusted individuals.
</Warning>

## How Roles Are Assigned

When you're invited to join the Business Process Framework, you're assigned a role by an Owner.

**During Onboarding**
1. An Owner sends you an invitation email
2. The invitation specifies your role
3. You accept the invitation and create your account
4. Your role is active immediately

**Requesting a Role Change**
If you need different permissions:
1. Contact your workspace Owner
2. Explain why you need the change
3. The Owner can update your role instantly
4. You'll receive a notification about the change

<Tip>
If you're unsure what your current role is, click your profile picture in the top right corner. Your role is displayed in your profile information.
</Tip>

## Permission Inheritance

Roles work on an inheritance model. This means higher roles can do everything lower roles can do, plus more.

**How It Works**
- Admin = Member permissions + admin permissions
- Owner = Admin permissions + owner permissions

**Why This Matters**
You never lose capabilities when you're promoted to a higher role. You only gain new ones.

## Role Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start with the minimum role needed">
    Always assign the lowest role that allows someone to do their job. You can upgrade later if needed. This principle is called "least privilege" and keeps your workspace secure.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Review roles regularly">
    Owners should review user roles every few months. Remove users who have left the company and adjust roles as job responsibilities change.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Document who has what role">
    Keep a list of who your Owners and Admins are. This helps during emergencies and when planning team changes.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Train Admins properly">
    Before giving someone Admin access, make sure they understand how to create and manage processes properly. Poor documentation is worse than no documentation.
