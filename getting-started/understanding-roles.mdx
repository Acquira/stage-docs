## What Are User Roles?

User roles determine what you can do in Stage3. Your role defines your level of access and the actions you can take.

There are three roles: Owner, Administrator, and Member. Each role builds on the previous one, giving you more capabilities as you move up.

## Member Role Explained

Members have read access to the processes shared with them. This is the most common role for regular team members.

**What Members Can Do**
- View all processes shared with them
- Search for processes
- Ask the AI assistant questions
- Leave comments and feedback
- Save favorite processes

- Change workspace settings

**Who Should Be a Member**
- Most employees
- New hires
- Contractors with limited access
- Anyone who needs to reference processes but not create them

<Tip>
Being a Member doesn't mean you're less important! Most users are Members, and that's perfectly fine for accessing and using your organization's processes.
</Tip>

## Administrator Role Explained

Administrators can create, edit, and manage processes. They're the process owners and content managers.

**What Administrators Can Do**

Everything Members can do, plus:
- Create new processes from scratch
- Edit any process they have access to
- Delete processes they created
- Organize processes into folders
- Share processes with specific users
- Upload and manage attachments
- Create templates for reuse
- Bulk import processes

**What Administrators Cannot Do**

- Delete the entire workspace

**Who Should Be an Administrator**
- Department managers
- Process owners
- Team leads
- Training coordinators
- Anyone responsible for documenting procedures

<Info>
Administrators are responsible for keeping processes accurate and up-to-date. If you're an Administrator, make sure to review your processes regularly.
</Info>

## Owner Role Explained

Owners have complete control over the workspace. There's usually only one or two Owners per organization.

**What Owners Can Do**

Everything Administrators can do, plus:
- Invite new team members
- Remove team members
- Change anyone's role
- Configure workspace settings
- Manage integrations
- Access all processes (even private ones)
- View usage analytics
- Manage billing and subscription
- Delete the workspace

**What Owners Should Be Careful About**
- Don't give Owner access to too many people
- Be cautious when deleting users or processes
- Review workspace settings before changing them
- Protect your login credentials carefully

**Who Should Be an Owner**
- Company executives
- IT administrators
- Business owners
- System managers

<Warning>
Owners have powerful privileges, including the ability to delete the entire workspace. Only assign this role to highly trusted individuals.
</Warning>

## How Roles Are Assigned

When you're invited to join Stage3, you're assigned a role by an Owner.

**During Onboarding**
1. An Owner sends you an invitation email
2. The invitation specifies your role (Member or Administrator)
3. You accept the invitation and create your account
4. Your role is active immediately

**Requesting a Role Change**

If you need different permissions:
1. Contact your workspace Owner
2. Explain why you need the change
3. The Owner can update your role instantly
4. You'll receive a notification about the change

<Tip>
To check your current role, go to Administration > Team Settings and look for your name in the Team Members table. Your role will be displayed there.
</Tip>

## Permission Inheritance

Roles work on an inheritance model. This means higher roles can do everything lower roles can do, plus more.

**How It Works**
- Administrator = Member permissions + administrator permissions
- Owner = Administrator permissions + owner permissions

**Why This Matters**

You never lose capabilities when you're promoted to a higher role. You only gain new ones.

## Role Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start with the minimum role needed">
    Always assign the lowest role that allows someone to do their job. You can upgrade later if needed. This principle is called "least privilege" and keeps your workspace secure.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Review roles regularly">
    Owners should review user roles every few months. Remove users who have left the company and adjust roles as job responsibilities change.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Document who has what role">
    Keep a list of who your Owners and Administrators are. This helps during emergencies and when planning team changes.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Train Administrators properly">
    Before giving someone Administrator access, make sure they understand how to create and manage processes properly. Poor documentation is worse than no documentation.
