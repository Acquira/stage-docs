## Understanding the Layout

The Business Process Framework has a simple, consistent layout that makes it easy to find your way around. Once you understand the main sections, you'll navigate with confidence.

The interface has three main navigation areas: the left sidebar, the top navigation bar, and the main content area.

## The Left Sidebar

The sidebar is your primary navigation menu. It's always visible and contains links to all major sections.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Dashboard" icon="house">
    Your home base showing recent activity, quick stats, and shortcuts to your work.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Processes" icon="book">
    Browse all processes available to you. This is where you'll spend most of your time.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Shared with Me" icon="share-nodes">
    Quick access to processes other people have shared with you.
  </Card>

  <Card title="My Processes" icon="user">
    Processes you've created or own. Only visible to Admins and Owners.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Teams" icon="users">
    View and manage teams in your workspace. What you see depends on your role.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Templates" icon="clipboard">
    Pre-built process templates you can use as starting points. Admins can create new templates.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
Click the collapse icon at the top of the sidebar to hide it and get more screen space. Click again to bring it back.

## Team Switcher

If you belong to multiple workspaces or teams, you'll see a team switcher at the top of the sidebar.

2. Select a different workspace from the dropdown
3. The page reloads with that workspace's content

**Why This Matters**
Each workspace is completely separate. Processes, users, and settings don't transfer between workspaces.

<Info>
Your role can be different in each workspace. You might be an Admin in one and a Member in another.
</Info>

## Understanding Menu Organization

The sidebar menu is organized by function to help you find things quickly:

### Content Navigation

### Administration (Owners Only)
- **Users**: Manage workspace members
- **Settings**: Workspace configuration
- **Analytics**: Usage reports and insights
- **Billing**: Subscription and payment

<Warning>
If you don't see an option in your menu, it means your role doesn't have access to that section.
</Warning>

## Customizing Your Navigation

You can personalize your navigation experience:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Reorder menu items">
    Some workspaces allow you to drag and drop menu items to reorder them. Put your most-used sections at the top.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Hide unused sections">
    In your Settings, you can hide menu sections you don't use. Keeps your sidebar clean and focused.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set your default page">
    Choose what page you see when you log in. Some people prefer the Dashboard, others prefer going straight to Processes.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Customize quick links">
    Add shortcuts to your most-used processes in your user menu for one-click access.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
Navigation customization options depend on your workspace settings. Not all workspaces allow full customization.
</Note>

## Navigation by Role

What you see in the menu depends on your role:

### Members See

- Processes
- Shared with Me
- Teams (view only)
- Search
- User menu

- My Processes
- Templates
- Process creation tools

### Owners See
- Everything Admins see

## Breadcrumb Navigation

Breadcrumbs show you where you are in the site hierarchy:

**How Breadcrumbs Work**
- Appear at the top of the page
- Show your path from home to current page
- Each level is clickable
- Great for navigating back up

**Example Breadcrumb Trail**
```
Home > Processes > Operations > Shipping > Packing Instructions
```

Click "Operations" to see all operation processes, or "Processes" to go to the main process list.

<Tip>
Breadcrumbs are especially useful in deeply nested folder structures. They help you understand context and navigate efficiently.
</Tip>

## Common Navigation Mistakes

<Warning>
**Using the browser's back button** can sometimes cause confusion. Use breadcrumbs or the sidebar instead for more predictable navigation.
</Warning>

**Opening too many tabs** can be confusing. The application works best with 1-2 tabs open. Use the built-in navigation instead.

**Not using search** is a missed opportunity. Search is often faster than clicking through menus and folders.

**Ignoring keyboard shortcuts** means slower navigation. Learn just 2-3 shortcuts and you'll work much faster.
