## Navigation by Role

The menu sections you can access depend on your user role:

### Members Typically See
- Dashboard

## Navigation Tips

**Use the Dashboard as Your Starting Point**  
The Dashboard gives you a complete overview. Start there each day to see what needs your attention.

**Expand Sections to See More Options**  
Don't forget that Process Framework, Tasks & Work, and Administration have subsections. Click the arrow to reveal them.

**AI Chat for Quick Help**  
Instead of searching through menus, try asking the AI Chat. It can guide you to the right section or answer your questions directly.

**Check Notifications Regularly**  
Click the notification bell to stay updated on tasks, workflows, and important changes.

**Take the Tour**  
If you're ever unsure where something is, click "Show Tour" to get a guided walkthrough of the platform.

## Mobile Navigation

On phones and tablets, the navigation adapts to smaller screens:

**Mobile Menu**
- Tap the hamburger icon (three lines) to open the sidebar menu
- Menu slides in from the left
- Tap outside the menu to close it
- All the same sections as desktop

**Mobile Tips**
- Swipe from the left edge to quickly open the menu
- The Dashboard is optimized for mobile viewing
- All sections stack vertically for easy scrolling

## Common Navigation Mistakes

**Not Expanding Subsections**  
Remember that Process Framework, Tasks & Work, and Administration have subsections. Click the arrow (>) to see all available options.

**Overlooking the AI Chat**  
The AI Chat can answer questions and guide you to the right place. Use it when you're not sure where to find something.

**Ignoring the Dashboard**  
The Dashboard is designed to be your home base. Start there to see what needs your attention.

**Missing Configuration Alerts**  
Check the bottom of the sidebar for important alerts like "Configure AI API Keys" that may need your attention.
