## What is the Business Process Framework?

The Business Process Framework is a web application that helps you document, organize, and manage all your business processes in one place. Think of it as your company's digital operations manual.

Instead of having process documents scattered across emails, folders, and people's heads, everything lives in one organized system. You can find what you need quickly, and everyone on your team sees the same up-to-date information.

## Who is it for?

This application is designed for business teams who want to:

- Document their standard operating procedures
- Onboard new team members faster
- Ensure consistency across operations
- Get instant answers about how things work

You don't need to be technical to use it. If you can use email and browse websites, you can use the Business Process Framework.
