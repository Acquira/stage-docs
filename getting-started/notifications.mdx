## Understanding Notifications

Notifications keep you updated about what's happening in the Business Process Framework. They tell you about new content, changes to processes, comments, and important updates.

Think of notifications as your personal assistant, tapping you on the shoulder when something needs your attention.

## The Notification Bell

The bell icon in the top right corner is your notification center.

**Visual Indicators**
- **Red dot**: You have unread notifications
- **Number badge**: Shows how many unread notifications
- **No indicator**: All caught up!

**Opening Notifications**
- Click the bell icon to open your notification panel
- Notifications appear in a dropdown
- Most recent notifications at the top
- Scroll to see older notifications

<Tip>
On mobile devices, the notification panel opens in a full-screen view for easier reading.
</Tip>

</Tip>

## Desktop and Mobile Notifications

Beyond email, you can enable browser and mobile notifications:

### Browser Notifications

**Enabling Browser Notifications**
1. Click "Enable Notifications" when prompted
2. Or enable in your browser settings for the site

**Disabling**
- Block in your browser settings
- Or disable in your app preferences

<Note>
Browser notifications work best when you keep a browser tab open for the application.
</Note>

**Push Notifications**
- Receive notifications on your phone or tablet
- Even when the app is closed
- Tap to open the relevant content

**Managing Mobile Notifications**

- Notifications resume automatically
- You'll receive a summary of what you missed
- Critical notifications may still come through

<Info>
Do Not Disturb is perfect for deep focus work or when you're presenting/in meetings.
</Info>

## Managing Notification Overload

Getting too many notifications? Here's how to fix it:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Switch to Digests" icon="envelope">
    Instead of real-time emails, get one daily or weekly summary. Reduces email clutter significantly.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Unfollow Processes" icon="eye-slash">
    If you're following processes you don't need updates about, unfollow them to reduce noise.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Adjust Comment Settings" icon="comment-slash">
    You don't need every comment notification. Set comments to in-app only or digest mode.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Filter by Importance" icon="filter">
    Focus on mentions and shared content. These usually need action. Other notifications can wait.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Notification Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Not receiving any notifications">
    Check these settings:
    1. Notification preferences in your account settings
    2. Email notifications aren't going to spam
    3. Browser notifications are allowed
    4. Your email address is correct in your profile
    5. Do Not Disturb isn't enabled
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Receiving too many notifications">
    Ways to reduce notifications:
    1. Switch from real-time to digest emails
    2. Unfollow processes you don't need to track
    3. Turn off comment notifications
    4. Disable browser notifications
    5. Only keep @mention notifications on
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Missing important notifications">
    Make sure:
    1. @mention notifications are enabled
    2. Shared content notifications are on
    3. Check your spam folder for emails
    4. You're not in Do Not Disturb mode
    5. Your role has access to see the content
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Old notifications won't clear">
    Try:
    1. Click "Mark all as read"
    2. Refresh your browser
    3. Clear browser cache
    4. Log out and log back in
    5. Contact support if issue persists
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Notification Best Practices

**Check Notifications Regularly**
Make it a habit to check notifications once or twice per day, even if you use email digests.

**Prioritize Mentions**
When you have notifications, check @mentions first. These usually need your response.

**Use Quiet Hours**
Set quiet hours for evenings and weekends so you can disconnect. Work-life balance matters!

**Don't Ignore All Notifications**
While it's tempting to disable everything, you'll miss important updates. Find a balance that works for you.

**Clean Up Periodically**
Every few weeks, review what you're following and unfollow processes you no longer need to track.

<Tip>
Treat notifications like email. Set specific times to check them rather than reacting to every alert immediately.
</Tip>
