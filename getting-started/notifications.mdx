## Understanding Notifications

Notifications keep you updated about what's happening in Stage3. They tell you about tasks, shared resources, team activities, and important updates.

Think of notifications as your personal assistant, letting you know when something needs your attention.

## The Notification Bell

The bell icon in the top right corner is your notification center.

**Visual Indicators**
- **Badge or dot**: You have unread notifications
- **No indicator**: All caught up!

**Opening Notifications**
- Click the bell icon to open your notification panel
- Notifications appear in a panel
- Most recent notifications at the top
- Easy to scan and review

<Tip>
When you're all caught up, you'll see "No notifications" with the message "You're all caught up! Check back later for new updates."
</Tip>

## Recommended Settings by Role

Different roles might prefer different notification settings:

### For Members

**Suggested Settings**
- **Task Assigned**: Email + In-App
- **Task Due Soon**: Email + In-App
- **Task Comment**: In-App only
- **Resource Shared**: Email + In-App
- **System Notification**: In-App only

**Why This Works**
You get immediate alerts for tasks that need your attention, but avoid email overload from less urgent updates.

### For Administrators

**Suggested Settings**
- **Task Assigned**: Email + In-App
- **Task Due Soon**: Email + In-App
- **Task Comment**: Email + In-App
- **Task Completed**: In-App only
- **Resource Shared**: Email + In-App
- **System Notification**: Email + In-App

**Why This Works**
You need to stay informed about team activities and task progress, with email alerts for important items.

### For Owners

**Suggested Settings**
- **Invitation Accepted**: Email + In-App
- **System Notification**: Email + In-App
- **Task Assigned**: In-App only
- **Resource Shared**: In-App only

**Why This Works**
You focus on system-level notifications and team management, while staying aware of tasks through in-app notifications.

<Tip>
Start with all notifications on and adjust after a few days. You'll quickly learn which ones you need and which ones create noise.
</Tip>

## Email Notifications

When email notifications are enabled for a type, you'll receive emails for those events.

**Email Content**
- Clear subject line describing the notification
- Summary of what happened
- Link to view details in the application
- Information about who triggered the action (when applicable)

**Managing Email Notifications**
- Turn off email for notification types you don't need
- Keep email on for urgent items like Task Assigned and Task Due Soon
- Check your spam folder if you're not receiving emails

<Warning>
Turning off email notifications means you must check the application regularly to stay updated. Make sure you don't miss important updates!
</Warning>

## In-App Notifications

In-app notifications appear within the Stage3 application.

**How They Work**
- Appear in the notification bell dropdown
- Visible when you're logged into the application
- Can be filtered and searched
- Stay in your notification panel until you review them

**Benefits of In-App**
- No email clutter
- All notifications in one organized place
- Easy to search and filter
- Context-rich with direct links

<Info>
In-app notifications are ideal for updates you want to see but don't need immediate email alerts for.
</Info>

## Managing Notification Overload

Getting too many notifications? Here's how to adjust:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Turn Off Email for Some Types" icon="envelope-open">
    Keep email for urgent items (Task Assigned, Task Due Soon) but use in-app only for others.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Disable Low-Priority Notifications" icon="bell-slash">
    Turn off both email and in-app for notification types you don't need, like Task Attachment if attachments aren't relevant to your work.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Use Filters" icon="filter">
    In the notification panel, use "Unread only" to focus on what you haven't seen yet.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Check Regularly" icon="clock">
    Set specific times to check notifications rather than reacting to every alert.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Notification Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Not receiving any notifications">
    Check these settings:
    1. Open Notification Preferences and verify toggles are on
    2. Check that email notifications aren't going to spam
    3. Verify your email address is correct in your profile
    4. Make sure you have tasks or activities that would generate notifications
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Receiving too many notifications">
    Ways to reduce notifications:
    1. Turn off email for less urgent notification types
    2. Disable in-app notifications you don't need
    3. Keep only critical notifications (Task Assigned, Task Due Soon) with email enabled
    4. Review and adjust after a few days of use
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Missing important notifications">
    Make sure:
    1. Task Assigned has both email and in-app enabled
    2. Task Due Soon is turned on
    3. Check your spam folder for emails
    4. Verify you're assigned to the tasks in question
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Email notifications not arriving">
    Try:
    1. Check spam/junk folder
    2. Verify email address in your profile is correct
    3. Confirm email toggle is on in Notification Preferences
    4. Contact your system administrator if issue persists
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Notification Best Practices

**Check Notifications Regularly**
Make it a habit to check the notification bell at least once or twice per day.

**Prioritize Task Notifications**
Focus on Task Assigned and Task Due Soon notifications first, as these usually require action.

**Customize to Your Workflow**
Everyone works differently. Adjust your preferences to match how you work best.

**Don't Disable Everything**
While it's tempting to turn off all notifications, you'll miss important updates. Find a balance.

**Review and Adjust**
After a week of use, review your preferences and adjust based on what's working.

<Tip>
Treat notifications like email. Set specific times to check them rather than being constantly distracted by every alert.
</Tip>
