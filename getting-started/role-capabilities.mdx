## Understanding Your Capabilities

Your role determines what actions you can take in the Business Process Framework. This page breaks down exactly what you can do based on your role.

Use the sections below to explore the capabilities for your specific role.

## Permission Inheritance Concept

Before diving into specifics, understand this important concept:

**Roles Build on Each Other**
- Admin can do everything Member can do, plus more
- Owner can do everything Admin can do, plus more

This means you never lose capabilities when promoted. You only gain new ones.

<Info>
If you see a feature grayed out or missing, it's likely because your role doesn't have permission. Contact your workspace Owner if you need access.

## Requesting Additional Permissions

If you need capabilities beyond your current role:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Identify what you need">
    Be specific about which features you need access to and why. This helps your Owner make an informed decision.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Contact your workspace Owner">
    Send a message or email explaining your request. Include how the additional access will help you do your job better.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Wait for approval">
    Your Owner will review your request and either upgrade your role or provide an alternative solution.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Learn your new capabilities">
    If approved, review this page again to understand your expanded permissions.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Sometimes you don't need a role change. For example, if you need to edit one specific process, an Admin can share it with you with edit permissions instead of making you an Admin.
