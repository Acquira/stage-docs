## Welcome!

This guide will walk you through your first 5 minutes with the Business Process Framework. By the end, you'll know how to navigate the application, view processes, and ask the AI questions.

Let's get started!

## Your First 5 Minutes

<Steps>
  <Step title="Log in to your account">
    Open your web browser and go to your organization's Business Process Framework URL. You should have received login credentials via email.

    Enter your email address and password, then click "Sign In". If this is your first time logging in, you may be asked to change your password.

    <Tip>
    Can't find your login email? Check your spam folder or contact your system administrator.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Explore your dashboard">
    After logging in, you'll land on your dashboard. This is your home base.

    Take a moment to look around:
    - **Top left**: The main menu to navigate different sections
    - **Center**: Your recent activity and quick stats
    - **Top right**: Notifications bell and your user menu

    The dashboard shows you what's happening across your processes and what you've been working on recently.

    <Info>
    Your dashboard is personalized to show the most relevant information for you.
    </Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="View your first process">
    Let's find and view a process. There are two easy ways:

    **Option 1: Use the search bar**
    - Click the search bar at the top of the page
    - Type a keyword related to what you're looking for
    - Click on any result to open that process

    **Option 2: Browse from the menu**
    - Click "Processes" in the left sidebar
    - Browse through the list of available processes
    - Click on any process title to open it

    When viewing a process, you'll see all the steps, attachments, and related information. Take your time to scroll through and see how processes are organized.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Ask the AI a question">
    One of the most powerful features is the AI assistant. Let's try it:

    - Look for the AI chat icon (usually in the bottom right corner)
    - Click it to open the chat window
    - Type a question like "How do I submit a time-off request?"
    - Press Enter and wait for the AI to respond

    The AI searches through all your processes and gives you an answer based on your company's actual procedures.

    <Note>
    The AI can only answer questions about processes that exist in your system. If you're not getting good answers, try rephrasing your question or make sure the process is documented.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Customize your experience">
    Before you finish, let's personalize your account:

    - Click your profile picture or initials in the top right corner
    - Select "Settings" or "Profile"
    - Add a profile picture (optional but helpful for team collaboration)
    - Review your notification preferences
    - Save any changes

    You're all set!
  </Step>
</Steps>

  <Accordion title="How do I know if a process has been updated?">
    You'll see notifications in the bell icon at the top right. The dashboard also shows recent activity. You can learn more on the [Notifications](/getting-started/notifications) page.

<Tip>
Take it slow! You don't need to learn everything at once. Focus on finding and viewing processes first, then explore other features as you need them.
