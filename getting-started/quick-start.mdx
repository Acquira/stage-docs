## Welcome!

This guide will walk you through your first 5 minutes with Stage3. By the end, you'll know how to navigate the application, view processes, and ask the AI questions.

Let's get started!

## Your First 5 Minutes

<Steps>
  <Step title="Log in to your account">
    Open your web browser and go to your organization's Stage3 URL. You should have received login credentials via email.

    Enter your email address and password, then click "Sign In". If this is your first time logging in, you may be asked to change your password.

    <Tip>
    Can't find your login email? Check your spam folder or contact your system administrator.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Explore your dashboard">
    After logging in, you'll land on your dashboard. This is your home base.

    Take a moment to look around:
    - **Left sidebar**: The main navigation menu (Platform) with Dashboard, Process Framework, Tasks & Work, Assessments, AI Chat, and Administration
    - **My Tasks**: Shows tasks assigned to you
    - **My Workflows**: Displays active workflows you're participating in
    - **Shared Resources**: Resources shared with you by team members
    - **Quick Overview**: Metrics showing Active Tasks, Active Workflows, and Shared Resources counts
    - **Team Overview**: Shows Process Cores, Workflow Templates, Active Workflows, and Team Tasks
    - **Top right**: Notifications bell and your user menu

    The dashboard shows you what's happening across your processes and what you've been working on recently.

    <Info>
    Your dashboard is personalized to show the most relevant information for you.

  </Step>

  <Step title="View your first process">
    Let's find and view a process:

    **Navigate to Business Processes:**
    - Click **"Process Framework"** in the left sidebar
    - Select **"Business Processes"** from the submenu
    - You'll see a list of process categories (Strategic Planning Layer, Core Value Chain, Enabling Processes)
    - Click on any Master Process to see its Core Processes
    - Click on a Core Process to view its details, activities, and documentation

    When viewing a process, you'll see tabs for:
    - **RACI**: Responsibility matrix showing who does what
    - **SOP**: Standard Operating Procedures
    - **Visual**: Process Flow diagram
    - **Swimlane**: Cross-functional process view
    - **KPIs**: Key Performance Indicators

    Take your time to explore these different views and see how processes are organized.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Ask the AI a question">
    One of the most powerful features is the AI assistant. Let's try it:

    - Click **"AI Chat"** in the left sidebar (under Platform navigation)
    - This opens the AI Chat Assistant
    - Type a question like "How do I submit a time-off request?"
    - Press Enter and wait for the AI to respond

    The AI searches through all your processes and gives you an answer based on your company's actual procedures.

    <Note>
    The AI can only answer questions about processes that exist in your system. If you're not getting good answers, try rephrasing your question or make sure the process is documented.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Customize your experience">
    Before you finish, let's personalize your account:

    - Click **"Administration"** in the left sidebar
    - Select **"Team Settings"**
    - You can manage your organization information and team members here
    - Review notification preferences by clicking the notifications bell icon and then "Preferences"
    - Customize which notifications you receive via Email and In-App

    You're all set!
  </Step>
</Steps>
