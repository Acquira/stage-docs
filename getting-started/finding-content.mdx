## Why Finding Content Matters

In a growing library of processes, finding what you need quickly is essential. Stage3 gives you multiple ways to discover content, from the AI assistant to smart navigation.

You shouldn't have to remember where everything is. Let the tools do the work for you.

## Using the AI Assistant to Find Content

The AI assistant is your most powerful tool for finding content. It's like having a knowledgeable coworker who knows where everything is.

**Ask in Natural Language**
Instead of searching keywords, ask questions:
- "How do I submit vacation requests?"
- "Where is the process for handling customer complaints?"
- "What's the procedure for closing at end of day?"

**Get Direct Answers**
The AI doesn't just find processes – it gives you answers:
- Summarizes the relevant process
- Points to the specific section you need
- Provides links to full processes for details

**Follow-Up Questions**
You can have a conversation:
1. You: "How do I process refunds?"
2. AI: [Explains the process]
3. You: "What if the customer paid by check?"
4. AI: [Explains the specific scenario]

<Tip>
Access the AI Chat from the left sidebar anytime you need help finding something. The more specific your question, the better the answer.
</Tip>

## Search Within Specific Sections

Some sections of the platform have built-in search functionality to help you find content within that area.

### Search in My Workflows

When viewing your workflows, you'll find a search bar that lets you search within your workflow instances:

**How to Use**
1. Navigate to Process Framework > My Workflows
2. Use the "Search workflows..." bar
3. Type what you're looking for
4. Results appear instantly

**Filter Options**
The My Workflows section includes filters:
- **All Statuses**: Filter workflows by their current status
- **All Roles**: Filter by role assignments

<Info>
Search and filter options vary by section. Look for search bars and filter dropdowns within each area of the platform.
</Info>

## Navigating the Process Framework

The Process Framework organizes content into clear categories and structures.

### Business Processes Overview

When you click on "Business Processes" in the sidebar, you'll see:

**Key Metrics at the Top**
- **Process Categories**: Number of category groups (Strategic, Core, Enabling)
- **Total Master Processes**: All processes across categories
- **Total Core Processes (Team)**: Core processes for your team
- **Activities (Team)**: Team activities

**Three Main Category Groups**

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Strategic Planning Layer" icon="chart-line">
    High-level processes that define organizational direction. Includes strategy formulation, market analysis, and vision definition.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Core Value Chain" icon="link">
    Revenue-generating processes. The main flow from market engagement through sales and delivery to customer success.
  </Card>

**Process Cards**

- Visual icon/abbreviation

### My Workflows

</Note>

## Breadcrumb Navigation

Breadcrumbs show you where you are in the platform and provide quick navigation:

**How Breadcrumbs Work**
- Appear at the top of pages
- Show your current path (e.g., "Dashboard > Business Processes")
- Each level is clickable
- Click any level to navigate back

**Example Navigation Paths**
```
Dashboard > Business Processes
Dashboard > My Workflows
Administration > Team Settings
```

<Tip>
Use breadcrumbs to quickly navigate back to parent sections without using the sidebar menu.
</Tip>

## Navigating Between Sections

The left sidebar is your primary navigation tool:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access main sections">
    Click Dashboard, Process Framework, Tasks & Work, Assessments, AI Chat, or Administration in the sidebar.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Expand subsections">
