## Why Finding Content Matters

In a growing library of processes, finding what you need quickly is essential. The Business Process Framework gives you multiple ways to discover content, from powerful search to smart filtering.

You shouldn't have to remember where everything is. Let the tools do the work for you.

## The Search Bar

The search bar is your most powerful tool for finding content.

### Basic Search

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open search">
    Click the search bar at the top or press `Ctrl+K` (Windows) or `Cmd+K` (Mac).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Type your search">
    Start typing what you're looking for. You'll see results instantly as you type.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review results">
    Results show:
    - Process title and description
    - Where it's located (folder/category)
    - When it was last updated
    - Relevance score (best matches at top)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Open a result">
    Click any result to open that process. Press `Esc` to close search without opening anything.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Search looks through process titles, descriptions, content, tags, and even comments. You don't need to know the exact title.
</Tip>

### Search Tips and Tricks

**Use Quotes for Exact Phrases**
- Search: `expense report` → finds processes with "expense" OR "report"
- Search: `"expense report"` → finds only processes with the exact phrase

**Search by Category**
- Add category filters to narrow results
- Example: Search for "onboarding" and filter to "HR"

**Search Recent Content**
- Use filters to show only recently updated processes
- Great for finding what's new

**Partial Matching**
- You don't need to type complete words
- "ship" will find "shipping", "shipped", "shipment"

<Info>
Search results are personalized. You only see processes you have permission to access.
</Info>

## Using the AI Assistant to Find Content

The AI assistant is like having a knowledgeable coworker who knows where everything is.

**Ask in Natural Language**
Instead of searching keywords, ask questions:
- "How do I submit vacation requests?"
- "Where is the process for handling customer complaints?"
- "What's the procedure for closing at end of day?"

**Get Direct Answers**
The AI doesn't just find processes – it gives you answers:
- Summarizes the relevant process
- Points to the specific section you need
- Provides links to full processes for details

**Follow-Up Questions**
You can have a conversation:
1. You: "How do I process refunds?"
2. AI: [Explains the process]
3. You: "What if the customer paid by check?"
4. AI: [Explains the specific scenario]

<Tip>
Think of the AI as your personal guide. The more specific your question, the better the answer.
</Tip>

## Browsing and Filtering

Sometimes you want to explore rather than search for something specific.

### The Processes Page

The main Processes page shows all available content with powerful filtering:

**View Options**
- **List View**: Shows processes as a list with details
- **Grid View**: Shows processes as cards with icons
- **Compact View**: More processes on screen at once

**Sorting Options**
- Most recent first
- Alphabetical by title
- Most viewed
- Recently updated
- Your recently viewed

### Filter Panel

Use filters to narrow down what you see:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Filter by Category">
    Categories organize processes by department or function:
    - HR
    - Operations
    - Sales
    - Customer Service
    - Finance
    - IT

    Select one or more categories to see only those processes.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Filter by Tag">
    Tags are keywords associated with processes:
    - Onboarding
    - Manager approval required
    - Customer-facing
    - Quick reference

    Click tags to filter. Click multiple tags to see processes matching all selected tags.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Filter by Owner">
    See processes created by specific people:
    - Select a person from the dropdown
    - Useful for finding all processes from a department lead
    - Admins and Owners see more owner filter options
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Filter by Status">
    Different process states:
    - Published (ready to use)
    - Draft (work in progress)
    - Under review (pending approval)
    - Archived (outdated but kept for reference)

    Most users only see Published processes by default.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Filter by Date">
    Time-based filters:
    - Updated in last 7 days
    - Updated in last 30 days
    - Created this month
    - Custom date range

    Great for seeing what's new or changed recently.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Note>
Active filters appear as chips at the top of the process list. Click the X on any chip to remove that filter.
</Note>

## Folder Navigation

Processes can be organized in folders, just like files on your computer.

**Navigating Folders**
- Click a folder name to open it
- See subfolders and processes inside
- Use breadcrumbs to navigate back up
- Search works within folders too

**Folder Shortcuts**
- Right-click folders for quick actions
- Add folders to favorites for quick access
- Recent folders appear in your dashboard

**Understanding Folder Structure**
Most workspaces organize folders by:
- Department (HR, Sales, Operations)
- Process type (Onboarding, Customer Service, Admin)
- Function (Opening procedures, Closing procedures)

<Tip>
If you can't find a process, try going up to the parent folder and using search from there.
</Tip>

## Quick Navigation Features

### Recent Items

Your recently viewed processes appear in several places:
- Top of the Processes page
- Your dashboard
- Search results (prioritized)
- Quick access menu

**Why It's Useful**
You don't need to search for something you just looked at. Recent items give you one-click access.

### Favorites and Pins

Mark important processes for quick access:

**Adding to Favorites**
1. Open any process
2. Click the star icon
3. Process is added to your Favorites list

**Pinning to Dashboard**
1. Right-click any process (or long-press on mobile)
2. Select "Pin to Dashboard"
3. Process appears in your dashboard's pinned section

**Managing Favorites and Pins**
- View all favorites from the sidebar
- Unpin by clicking the pin icon again
- Organize favorites into custom collections

<Info>
Favorites and pins are personal. What you pin doesn't affect what other people see.
</Info>

## Advanced Search Techniques

For power users who want to find content faster:

### Search Operators

Use special operators to refine searches:

| Operator | Example | What It Does |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| `"exact phrase"` | `"customer refund"` | Finds exact phrase |
| `title:keyword` | `title:onboarding` | Searches only titles |
| `tag:keyword` | `tag:urgent` | Finds by tag |
| `owner:name` | `owner:john` | Finds by creator |
| `-keyword` | `sales -international` | Excludes a word |

**Combining Operators**
You can combine multiple operators:
```
title:shipping tag:priority -archived
```
This finds processes with "shipping" in the title, tagged "priority", but not archived.

### Saved Searches

If you run the same search frequently, save it:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Run your search">
    Search and apply all your desired filters.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save the search">
    Click "Save Search" button (usually near the search bar).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Name your search">
    Give it a descriptive name like "My daily checklists" or "Customer service escalations".
  </Step>

  <Step title="Access saved searches">
    Saved searches appear in your sidebar or search dropdown for one-click access.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Saved searches automatically update. If new processes match your criteria, they'll appear in your saved search results.
</Tip>

## Understanding Search Results

Search results show more than just titles:

**Result Information**
- **Title**: The process name
- **Description**: Brief summary of what it covers
- **Location**: What folder it's in
- **Last Updated**: When it was modified
- **Relevance**: Why it matched your search

**Result Snippets**
Results show snippets of matching content:
- Highlighted keywords show where matches occur
- Context around the match helps you verify relevance
- Click to see the full process

**Result Ordering**
Results are ordered by relevance:
1. Exact title matches
2. Description matches
3. Content matches
4. Tag matches
5. Comment matches

You can change the sort order using the sort dropdown.

## Mobile Search and Navigation

Finding content on phones and tablets works a bit differently:

**Mobile Search**
- Tap the search icon to open search overlay
- Full-screen search is easier to use on small screens
- Recent searches appear first
- Tap results to open immediately

**Mobile Filtering**
- Tap the filter icon to show filters
- Filters slide in from the bottom
- Apply filters and swipe down to close
- Active filters show as chips

**Mobile Navigation**
- Swipe from left edge to open menu
- Use breadcrumbs to navigate up
- Pull down to refresh content
- Tap and hold for context menus

## Finding Shared Content

Content shared with you is easy to find:

**Shared with Me Section**
- Dedicated section in the sidebar
- Shows all processes shared with you
- Sorted by most recently shared
- See who shared each process

**Shared Indicators**
- Shared processes have a special icon
- Hover to see who shared it and when
- See your permission level (View, Comment, Edit)

**Filtering Shared Content**
- Filter by who shared it
- Filter by when it was shared
- Filter by permission level

<Note>
If someone shares a process in a folder, the whole folder might appear in your Shared with Me section.
</Note>

## Troubleshooting Search Issues
