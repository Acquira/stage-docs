## Your Dashboard at a Glance

Your dashboard is the first thing you see when you log in. It's designed to give you a quick overview of what's happening and help you jump back into your work.

Think of it as your command center. Everything important is just one click away.

## Dashboard Sections

### Quick Stats

At the top of your dashboard, you'll see key numbers that give you a snapshot of your workspace:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Total Processes" icon="book">
    The number of processes available to you. This includes processes you've created and those shared with you.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Recent Activity" icon="clock">
    Shows how many processes have been updated recently. Helps you stay current with changes.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Your Contributions" icon="user">
    Tracks processes you've created or edited. See your impact on the organization's knowledge base.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Team Members" icon="users">
    The number of people in your organization or team using the platform.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Recent Activity Feed

The center of your dashboard shows what's been happening recently:

**What You'll See**
- Processes that were recently created
- Updates to existing processes
- New comments or discussions
- Processes shared with you
- Team member activity

**Why It Matters**
This feed keeps you in the loop. You can see what your team is working on and catch important updates without searching for them.

<Tip>
Click on any item in the activity feed to jump directly to that process or update.
</Tip>

### My Recent Work

This section shows processes you've viewed, edited, or created recently. It's your personal shortcut to get back to what you were working on.

**Quick Access**
- Jump back to processes you were reading
- Continue editing work in progress
- Find that process you looked at yesterday

**Smart Ordering**
Items are sorted by when you last interacted with them. The most recent is always at the top.

### Pinned Processes

If you use certain processes frequently, you can pin them to your dashboard for instant access.

**How to Pin a Process**
1. Open any process
2. Look for the pin icon (usually near the title)
3. Click to pin it to your dashboard

**Managing Pins**
- Pin up to 10 processes
- Unpin by clicking the pin icon again
- Rearrange pins by dragging and dropping

<Note>
Pinned processes are personal to you. Pinning something doesn't affect what other people see.
</Note>

### Notifications Preview

A quick view of your most recent notifications appears on the dashboard. This helps you stay informed without opening the full notifications panel.

You'll see alerts about:
- Processes shared with you
- Comments on processes you follow
- Important updates from your team
- System announcements

Click "View All" to see your complete notification history.

## Customizing Your Dashboard

You can personalize your dashboard to show what matters most to you.

  </Step>

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Dashboard Tips and Tricks

**Use the Dashboard as Your Home Base**
After viewing a process or working in another section, click the home icon or logo to return to your dashboard.

**Check It Daily**
Make it a habit to glance at your dashboard each day. It only takes a few seconds to see what's new and important.

**Filter the Activity Feed**
Use the filter options to show only certain types of activity. For example, show only updates to processes you own.

**Refresh for Latest Updates**
The dashboard updates automatically, but you can click the refresh icon to get the very latest information.

**Use Quick Actions**
Look for shortcut buttons on the dashboard like "Create New Process" or "View All Processes" for faster navigation.

## Understanding Activity Icons

The dashboard uses icons to help you quickly identify different types of activity:

| Icon | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| üìù | Process created or edited |
| üí¨ | New comment or discussion |
| üîî | Shared with you |
| ‚≠ê | Featured or important |
| üë• | Team activity |
| üîÑ | Updated content |

<Tip>
Hover your mouse over any icon or item to see more details in a tooltip.
</Tip>

## Dashboard Performance

Your dashboard loads quickly because it only shows recent information. Older activity is available through the full activity log or history pages.

**Automatic Refresh**
The dashboard refreshes automatically every few minutes when you have the page open. You don't need to manually reload.

**Mobile View**
On phones and tablets, the dashboard adapts to show the most important information first. Scroll down to see additional sections.

<Warning>
If your dashboard seems slow or isn't loading properly, try refreshing your browser or clearing your browser cache.
