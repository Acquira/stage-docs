## Your Dashboard at a Glance

Your dashboard is the first thing you see when you log in. It's designed to give you a quick overview of what's happening and help you jump back into your work.

Think of it as your command center. Everything important is just one click away.

## Dashboard Sections

### My Tasks

Shows tasks that have been assigned to you. This is where you'll see work that needs your attention.

**When Empty:**
- Displays "No tasks yet"
- Message: "Tasks assigned to you will appear here"

**When Active:**
- List of tasks with details
- Click any task to view more information

<Tip>
Check My Tasks daily to stay on top of your responsibilities.
</Tip>

### My Workflows

Displays workflow instances you're actively participating in. These are automated processes where you have a role.

**When Empty:**
- Displays "No active workflows"
- Message: "Workflows you're participating in will appear here"

**When Active:**
- Shows workflows with your involvement
- Click any workflow to see details and take action

### Shared Resources

Shows files, documents, and resources that team members have shared with you.

**When Empty:**
- Displays "No shared resources"
- Message: "Resources shared with you will appear here"

**When Active:**
- List of shared items with who shared them

### Quick Overview

Provides high-level metrics for your personal work:

- **Active Tasks**: Number of tasks currently assigned to you
- **Active Workflows**: Count of workflows you're participating in
- **Shared Resources**: Total resources shared with you

These numbers update automatically as your work changes.

## Dashboard Layout

The dashboard is organized into two columns:

**Left Column:**
- My Tasks
- My Workflows
- Shared Resources

**Right Column:**
- Quick Overview (your metrics)
- Team Overview (organization metrics)

This layout helps you quickly scan what needs your attention (left) and understand the bigger picture (right).

## Understanding Empty States

When you first start using Stage3, your dashboard sections may be empty. This is normal! As you create processes, get assigned tasks, and collaborate with teammates, these sections will populate with relevant information.

Empty states show helpful messages explaining what will appear in each section once you start working.

## Navigation from Dashboard

Your dashboard includes quick access to key areas:

**Top Navigation:**
- **Show Tour**: Click to take a guided tour of the application
- **Support**: Access help and documentation
- **Open App**: Direct link to the main application (when viewing docs)

**Left Sidebar (Platform):**
- **Dashboard**: Return to this view anytime
- **Process Framework**: Access Business Processes and My Workflows
- **Tasks & Work**: View My Tasks and Team Tasks
- **Assessments**: Access assessment tools
- **AI Chat**: Open the AI assistant
- **Administration**: Manage team settings (if you have permissions)

<Note>
The left sidebar is always available, making it easy to navigate from the dashboard to any other area of the application.
</Note>

## Dashboard Tips and Tricks

**Use the Dashboard as Your Home Base**

After viewing a process or working in another section, click "Dashboard" in the left sidebar to return to your dashboard.

**Check It Daily**

Make it a habit to glance at your dashboard each day. It only takes a few seconds to see what's new and important.

**Understand Your Metrics**

The Quick Overview shows your personal workload. If your Active Tasks number is high, you may need to prioritize or delegate.

**Monitor Team Overview**

Keep an eye on team metrics. If Active Workflows is growing rapidly, your team may be scaling up operations.

**Empty Sections Are Okay**

Not all sections will always have content. If My Workflows is empty, it simply means you're not currently involved in any automated workflows.

## Dashboard Performance

Your dashboard loads quickly because it shows real-time information from the system.

**Automatic Updates**

Dashboard metrics update automatically when:
- Tasks are assigned or completed
- Workflows start or finish
- Resources are shared with you
- Team members create new processes

**Mobile View**

On phones and tablets, the dashboard adapts to show information in a single column. Scroll down to see all sections.

<Warning>
If your dashboard seems slow or isn't loading properly, try refreshing your browser or clearing your browser cache.
</Warning>

## What's Not on the Dashboard

The dashboard focuses on actionable items and high-level metrics. For detailed work, you'll need to navigate to specific sections:

**Not on Dashboard:**
- Full process documentation (go to Process Framework)
- Detailed task management (go to Tasks & Work)
- Team member management (go to Administration)
- Complete notification history (click the bell icon)
- AI Chat conversations (go to AI Chat in sidebar)

The dashboard is intentionally simple to avoid overwhelming you with information.

## Customization

Currently, the dashboard layout is standardized to ensure consistency across your organization. All users see the same sections in the same order.

<Info>
Dashboard customization features may be added in future updates. Check with your system administrator for the latest capabilities.
