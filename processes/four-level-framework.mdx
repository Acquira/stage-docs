## What is the 4-Level Framework?

Stage3 uses a 4-level hierarchy to organize all your business processes. This structure helps you understand how everything in your business connects, from high-level strategy down to daily tasks.

Think of it like organizing a library:
1.  **Master Process** (The Library Section, e.g., "Non-Fiction")
2.  **Core Process** (The Specific Aisle, e.g., "History")
3.  **Category** (The Shelf, e.g., "World War II")
4.  **Activity** (The Book, e.g., "D-Day Landings")

<Info>
The framework provides the high-level structure (Level 1). You'll focus on creating Core Processes (Level 2), Categories (Level 3), and Activities (Level 4).

## The 4 Levels Explained

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Level 1: Master Process (The Framework)" icon="sitemap" defaultOpen>
    These are the 33 high-level processes predefined by Acquira (e.g., *Environmental Scanning*, *Lead to Sale*). They are grouped into three main categories:

    <CardGroup cols={3}>
      <Card title="Strategic Planning Layer" icon="chess" color="#3b82f6">
        High-level processes that define organizational direction.
      </Card>
      <Card title="Core Value Chain" icon="gears" color="#10b981">
        Revenue-generating processes (e.g., *Market to Lead*, *Lead to Sale*).
      </Card>
      <Card title="Enabling Processes" icon="wrench" color="#8b5cf6">
        Supporting functions like HR, finance, and legal.
      </Card>
    </CardGroup>

    **Your role:** You don't create or edit Master Processes. You choose the one that best fits the process you want to build.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Level 2: Core Process (Your Process)" icon="pen-to-square">
    This is the specific process you create **inside** a Master Process. You give it a name (e.g., "Sales Funnel Q4") and a version.

    **This is where you:**
    - Create processes specific to your business
    - Document your Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
    - Build your RACI matrix
    - View the process flow

    **Example:** You select the `Hire to Retire` Master Process (Level 1), then create a Core Process named `"Remote Team Onboarding"` (Level 2).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Level 3: Category (The Phases)" icon="layer-group">
    Categories are the phases or stages **within** your Core Process. They are used to group activities.

    - They are created **automatically** when you add an activity and type in a new category name.
    - Each category gets a unique color for visual organization.

    **Example:** Inside your `"Remote Team Onboarding"` Core Process, you might create categories like `"Pre-Arrival"`, `"First Week"`, and `"30-Day Check-in"`.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Level 4: Activity (The Tasks)" icon="list-check">
    Activities are the individual tasks that make up your Core Process. These are the actual steps your team performs.

    **This is where you:**
    - Define the task (e.g., "Send Welcome Email")
    - Assign **RACI** (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed)
    - Create step-by-step **Guides** or **SOPs**
    - Add **Forms** to Guides

    **Example activities for `"First Week"` category:**
    - Assign equipment
    - Schedule team introduction
    - Complete HR paperwork
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Visual Representation (Correct Hierarchy)

Here's how the levels *actually* connect:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Level 1: Master Process">
    **Hire to Retire** (One of 33 predefined processes)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Level 2: Core Process (Your Work)">
    **"Remote Team Onboarding"** (Your specific process)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Level 3: Category">
    **"First Week"** (A phase you define)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Level 4: Activities">
    - Assign equipment (R: IT, A: Manager)
    - Schedule team introduction
    - Complete HR paperwork
  </Step>
</Steps>
