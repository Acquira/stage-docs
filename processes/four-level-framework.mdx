## What is the Four-Level Framework?

The Business Process Framework uses a four-level hierarchy to organize all your business processes. This structure helps you understand how everything in your business connects, from high-level strategy down to daily tasks.

Think of it like organizing a library. You have major sections, then specific genres, then individual books, then chapters within each book.

<Info>
The four-level framework is already built for you. You'll focus on Level 3 (Core Processes) where you document your team's actual work.

## The Four Levels Explained

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Level 1: Categories" icon="layer-group" defaultOpen>
    Categories represent the highest level of organization. There are three main categories that cover every type of business activity:

    <CardGroup cols={3}>
      <Card title="Strategic Processes" icon="chess" color="#3b82f6">
        Long-term planning and direction setting. Examples: Business planning, strategy development.
      </Card>
      <Card title="Core Processes" icon="gears" color="#10b981">
        Activities that directly create value for customers. Examples: Sales, production, service delivery.
      </Card>
      <Card title="Enabling Processes" icon="wrench" color="#8b5cf6">
        Support functions that keep the business running. Examples: HR, IT, accounting.
      </Card>
    </CardGroup>

    **Your role:** You don't create categories. They're already defined in the framework.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Level 2: Master Processes" icon="sitemap">
    Master Processes are the major process areas within each category. These are standardized across all businesses using the framework.

    **Examples of Master Processes:**
    - Marketing & Sales (Core)
    - Operations Management (Core)
    - Human Resources (Enabling)
    - Financial Management (Enabling)
    - Strategic Planning (Strategic)

    There are dozens of pre-defined master processes covering every business function.

    **Your role:** You select which master process your core process belongs to. You don't create new master processes.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Level 3: Core Processes (Your Work Lives Here)" icon="pen-to-square">
    Core Processes are where YOU do your work. This is your team's specific implementation of a master process.

    **This is where you:**
    - Create processes specific to your business
    - Document how your team actually works
    - Add activities, RACI assignments, and documentation
    - Customize everything to match your operations

    **Example:** The master process "Recruit and Onboard Employees" might become your core process called "New Hire Onboarding for Remote Team" with your company's specific steps.

    <Tip>
    Focus your energy here! Level 3 is where you'll spend most of your time in the system.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Level 4: Activities" icon="list-check">
    Activities are the individual tasks that make up your core process. These are the actual steps your team performs.

    **Activities include:**
    - Specific tasks to complete
    - RACI role assignments
    - Step-by-step guides
    - Forms and documentation
    - KPIs to track performance

    **Example activities for "New Hire Onboarding":**
    - Post job opening
    - Review applications
    - Conduct phone screens
    - Schedule interviews
    - Make job offer
    - Complete paperwork
    - Assign equipment

    You'll organize activities into categories and add detailed documentation to each one.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Level 3: Core Process (Your Work)">
    **New Hire Onboarding for Remote Team** (your specific implementation)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Level 4: Activities">
    - Post job opening
    - Review applications
    - Conduct phone screens
    - Schedule interviews
    - Make job offer
    - Complete paperwork
    - Assign equipment
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Why This Structure Matters

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Consistency" icon="arrows-to-circle">
    Everyone in your organization uses the same framework, making it easy to understand different departments.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Clarity" icon="lightbulb">
    Clear hierarchy shows how individual tasks connect to bigger business goals.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Standardization" icon="stamp">
    Pre-defined levels 1 and 2 ensure you're using industry best practices.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Flexibility" icon="wand-magic-sparkles">
    Levels 3 and 4 let you customize everything to match how you actually work.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## What You'll Create

When you use the Business Process Framework, you'll create:

1. **Core Processes** (Level 3) - Your team's specific processes
2. **Activities** (Level 4) - The tasks within each process
3. **Documentation** - SOPs, guides, and blueprints
4. **RACI assignments** - Who does what
5. **KPIs** - How you measure success

The framework handles the rest automatically.

<Note>
**Remember:** You work at Levels 3 and 4. Levels 1 and 2 provide the structure and organization that makes everything easier to find and understand.
