## What Are Activity Categories?

Activity categories are automatic groupings that organize activities within your core process. They help you structure complex processes into logical phases or stages, making them easier to understand and navigate.

<Info>
Categories are created automatically when you specify a category name while creating an activity. You don't create categories separately - they appear as you build your process.
</Info>

## How Categories Work in MPQA

Categories in MPQA are **automatically generated** based on the activities you create:

1. **Categories are created through activities** - When you create an activity and enter text in the "Category" field, the system automatically creates that category if it doesn't exist yet.

2. **Colors are assigned automatically** - The system assigns a unique color to each category automatically. You cannot manually choose category colors.

3. **Activities are grouped by category** - In the RACI matrix view, activities are grouped under their category headers.

4. **Visual representation** - In the Visual and Process Flow tabs, each category appears as a colored bar with activities displayed beneath it.

## Why Use Categories?

Categories provide several benefits for process organization:

- **Visual organization** - Color-coded category bars make it easy to distinguish between different phases at a glance
- **Logical grouping** - Group related activities together to show stages or phases of your workflow
- **Better navigation** - Categories create clear sections in the RACI matrix
- **Process insights** - The system tracks how many categories (process phases) exist

## Creating Your First Category

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Your Core Process">
    Go to **Business Processes** in the left sidebar and select the core process where you want to add activities.

    Make sure you're on the **RACI** tab to view and manage activities.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click Add Activity">
    Click the blue **"Add Activity"** button in the top right of the RACI matrix.

    This opens the "Create New Activity" dialog.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter Activity Details">
    Fill in the required information:
    - **Activity Name** (required)
    - **Responsible** (R): Who does the work
    - **Accountable** (A): Who approves the work
    - **Consulted** (C): Who provides input
    - **Informed** (I): Who is kept updated
  </Step>

  <Step title="Specify a Category Name">
    In the **"Category"** field (optional), type the name of the phase or stage this activity belongs to.

    **Examples of good category names:**
    - "Initial Screening"
    - "Planning Phase"
    - "Execution"
    - "Final Review"
    - "Post-Launch"

    <Tip>
    If you leave the Category field empty, the activity will still be created but won't be grouped under a specific category.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create the Activity">
    Click **"Create Activity"** to save.

    The category you specified will automatically appear in the RACI matrix as a new section header, and your activity will be listed underneath it.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Adding More Activities to an Existing Category

To add additional activities to a category that already exists:

1. Click the **"Add Activity"** button to create another activity
2. In the "Category" field, type the **exact same name** as your existing category
3. The system will automatically group this new activity under the existing category
4. Fill in the rest of the activity details and click **"Create Activity"**

<Warning>
Category names are case-sensitive. "Planning Phase" and "planning phase" would create two separate categories. Make sure to use exact spelling and capitalization.
</Warning>

## Category Naming Best Practices

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Do">
    Use clear, descriptive phase names:
    - "Discovery Phase"
    - "Budget Approval" 
    - "Implementation"
    - "Quality Review"

    Be consistent with naming patterns:
    - "Phase 1: Planning"
    - "Phase 2: Execution"
    - "Phase 3: Review"

    Keep names concise (2-4 words):
    - "Initial Screening"
    - "Final Approval"
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Don't">
    Avoid vague or generic names:
    - "Category 1"
    - "Other Stuff"
    - "Miscellaneous"

    Don't make names too long:
    - "This is the category for all activities related to planning"

    Avoid inconsistent naming:
    - "Planning", "Execution of Tasks", "After Everything is Done"
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Common Category Patterns

Different types of processes benefit from different category structures:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Time-Based Phases">
    **Best for:** Processes with clear time-based stages

    **Example: Employee Onboarding**
    - Pre-Arrival Preparation
    - First Day Activities
    - First Week Training
    - 30-Day Integration
    - 90-Day Review

    **Why this works:** Clear time-based progression with distinct phases showing the journey.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Functional Groups">
    **Best for:** Processes with distinct functional areas

    **Example: Product Launch**
    - Product Development
    - Marketing Preparation
    - Sales Enablement
    - Launch Execution
    - Post-Launch Analysis

    **Why this works:** Functional groups that clearly delineate different types of work.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Approval Gates">
    **Best for:** Processes with decision points

    **Example: Investment Approval**
    - Initial Request
    - Financial Analysis
    - Risk Assessment
    - Executive Approval
    - Implementation

    **Why this works:** Clear stages with the critical approval gate highlighted.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Customer Journey">
    **Best for:** Customer-facing processes

    **Example: Sales Process**
    - Lead Generation
    - Qualification
    - Proposal Development
    - Negotiation
    - Closing
    - Customer Onboarding

    **Why this works:** Follows the customer journey with clear handoff points.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## How Categories Appear in Different Views

Categories display differently depending on which tab you're viewing:

### RACI Tab

In the **RACI Responsibility Matrix** view:
- Categories appear as section headers with the category name
- Each category shows the count of activities it contains (e.g., "1 activities")
- Activities are listed in rows beneath their category header
- A **"Category Blueprint"** link appears next to each category name

### Visual Tab

In the **Process Flow** diagram:
- Each category appears as a **colored horizontal bar** across the top
- The category name is displayed on the left side of the bar
- Activity boxes appear beneath their respective category bar
- Each category has a unique automatically-assigned color (e.g., red, green, blue)
- **"Blueprint"** and **"Workflow"** links appear in each category bar

### Swimlane Tab

In the **Process Swimlane Chart**:
- Activities are organized by responsible person (swimlanes)
- Categories group activities horizontally within each swimlane
- This view shows the cross-functional flow of your process

## Understanding Category Colors

<Warning>
Category colors are assigned automatically by the system. You cannot manually choose or change category colors in MPQA.
</Warning>

The system assigns distinct colors to each category to make them visually distinguishable. These colors help you quickly identify which phase an activity belongs to when viewing process diagrams.

## Category Blueprint Feature

Each category has an associated **"Category Blueprint"** link that appears in the RACI view.

This feature allows you to:
- Define standard templates or guidelines for activities in that category
- Document best practices specific to that process phase
- Create reusable workflows for similar processes

## Editing and Managing Categories

### To Rename a Category

Since categories are created through activities, to rename a category:

1. Click the edit icon (pencil) next to each activity in the category you want to rename
2. In the "Edit RACI Assignments" dialog, update the activity's category name to the new desired name
3. Use the **same new name** for all activities you want grouped together
4. Click **"Save Changes"** for each activity
5. Once all activities have been updated, the old category will disappear and the new category will appear

### To Delete a Category

To remove a category completely:

1. Either delete all activities in that category, or edit them to assign them to a different category
2. Once no activities remain assigned to that category, it will automatically disappear from the RACI matrix and all views

<Warning>
There is no direct "delete category" button. Categories only exist as long as at least one activity is assigned to them.
</Warning>

## Process Flow Insights

When you have categories defined, MPQA provides insights about your process structure:

- **Total Activities:** Number of process steps defined
- **Categories:** Number of process phases (e.g., "2 process phases")
- **RACI Coverage:** Confirmation of clear accountability and responsibility assignments
- **Process Flow:** Indication of sequential progression through defined activities

These insights help you understand the complexity and completeness of your process documentation.

## Best Practices

**Plan your categories first**

Before creating activities, sketch out the main phases of your process to ensure consistent category naming.

**Use consistent naming**

Double-check spelling and capitalization when entering category names to avoid creating duplicate categories accidentally.

**Limit category count**

Aim for 3-7 categories per process. Too many categories can make the process harder to understand.

**Group logically**

Group activities that naturally belong together in the same workflow stage or functional area.

## How Many Categories Should You Use?

General guidelines for category count:

| Process Complexity | Recommended Categories | Example |
|-------------------|----------------------|---------|
| Simple (5-10 activities) | 2-3 categories | Basic approval workflow |
| Medium (10-25 activities) | 3-5 categories | Department onboarding |
| Large (25-50 activities) | 5-7 categories | Enterprise sales cycle |
| Very Large (50+ activities) | Consider splitting into multiple core processes | Full product development lifecycle |

<Tip>
If you find yourself needing more than 7-8 categories, consider whether your process should be split into multiple separate core processes instead.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting

**My activities aren't grouping under the same category**

Check that you're using the exact same spelling and capitalization for the category name. "Planning Phase" and "planning phase" are treated as two different categories.

**I can't find where to edit a category directly**

Categories can't be edited directly. You must edit the activities within that category to change or rename the category grouping.

**The category colors don't match my brand**

Category colors are assigned automatically by the system and cannot be customized. Focus on using clear category names instead.

**My category disappeared**

Categories automatically disappear when they no longer contain any activities. Check if all activities were deleted or moved to other categories.
