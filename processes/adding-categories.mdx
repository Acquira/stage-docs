## What Are Activity Categories?

Activity categories are groupings that organize the activities within your core process. Think of them as chapters in a book or phases in a project.

Categories help you organize complex processes into logical sections, making it easier to understand and navigate.

<Info>
Categories are optional but highly recommended for processes with more than 5-10 activities. They make large processes much easier to manage.
</Info>

## Why Use Categories?

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Visual Organization" icon="palette">

  </Card>
  <Card title="Logical Grouping" icon="layer-group">
    Group related activities together to show the phases or stages of your process.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Better Navigation" icon="map">

  <Card title="Clear Communication" icon="comments">
    When discussing the process, you can reference "the screening phase" instead of listing individual activities.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Common Category Patterns

Different types of processes use different category structures:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Sequential Phases">
    **Best for:** Time-based processes with clear stages

    **Example: Employee Onboarding**
    - Pre-Arrival Preparation
    - First Day Activities
    - First Week Training
    - 30-Day Integration
    - 90-Day Review
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Functional Groups">
    **Best for:** Processes with distinct functional areas

    **Example: Product Launch**
    - Product Development
    - Marketing Preparation
    - Sales Enablement
    - Launch Execution
    - Post-Launch Follow-up
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Decision-Based">
    **Best for:** Processes with approval gates or decision points

    **Example: Investment Approval**
    - Initial Request
    - Financial Analysis
    - Risk Assessment
    - Executive Approval
    - Implementation
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Customer Journey">
    **Best for:** Customer-facing processes

    **Example: Sales Process**
    - Lead Generation
    - Qualification
    - Proposal Development
    - Negotiation
    - Closing
    - Onboarding
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Creating Your First Category

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Your Core Process">
    Navigate to the core process where you want to add categories.

    Make sure you're in the main process view (not the Visual or Swimlane tabs).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Find the Add Category Button">
    Look for a button labeled **"Add Category"**, **"New Category"**, or a **"+"** icon in the activities section.

    This is usually above your activities list or in a sidebar.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Name Your Category">
    Choose a clear, concise name that describes this group of activities.

    **Good names:**
    - "Initial Screening"
    - "Budget Approval"
    - "Post-Launch Review"

    **Poor names:**
    - "Category 1"
    - "Stuff"
    - "Things We Do"

    Keep names short (2-4 words is ideal).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose a Color">
    Select a color for this category. The color will appear:
    - In activity boxes
    - In visual diagrams
    - In the process navigation

    <Tip>
    Choose colors that make sense together and provide good contrast. Many teams use a progression (light to dark) or traffic light colors (green, yellow, red) based on process stages.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add a Description (Optional)">
    Some systems let you add a description explaining what happens in this category.

    **Example:** "Initial Screening includes all activities from receiving the application through scheduling the first interview."

    This is helpful for complex processes or onboarding new team members.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save the Category">
    Click **"Save"** or **"Create"** to add your category.

    Your category will appear in the process, ready for you to add activities to it.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Organizing Categories

Once you have multiple categories, you can organize them to reflect the flow of your process.

### Reordering Categories

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Drag and Drop" icon="hand-pointer" defaultOpen>
    Most systems let you drag categories up or down to reorder them.

    Click and hold on a category, then drag it to the desired position. The order of categories in your list is the order they appear in diagrams and exports.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Move Up/Down Buttons" icon="arrows-up-down">
    If drag-and-drop isn't available, look for up/down arrow buttons next to each category.

    Click these to move a category one position at a time.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Number Prefixes" icon="list-ol">
    You can add numbers to category names for explicit ordering:
    - "1. Lead Generation"
    - "2. Qualification"
    - "3. Proposal"

    This keeps the order clear even when categories are expanded or collapsed.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Collapsing Categories

For large processes with many activities, you can collapse categories to hide their activities:

- **Collapsed:** Shows only the category name and activity count
- **Expanded:** Shows all activities within the category

This makes it easier to navigate long processes by focusing on one category at a time.

## Color Coding Best Practices

Colors are powerful visual tools, but use them wisely:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Be Consistent" icon="equals">
    Use similar colors for similar types of activities across different processes.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Use Progression" icon="arrow-right">
    For sequential processes, use colors that progress (light to dark, or through a spectrum).
  </Card>
  <Card title="Consider Meaning" icon="lightbulb">
    Green often means "go" or "done", red means "stop" or "critical", yellow means "caution".
  </Card>
  <Card title="Ensure Contrast" icon="adjust">
    Choose colors that are visually distinct, especially for adjacent categories.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Warning>
**Avoid:** Using too many bright colors or colors that are too similar. If your categories are hard to distinguish at a glance, the colors aren't helping.
</Warning>

## Category Naming Guidelines

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Do">
    ✅ Use clear, action-oriented names
    - "Conduct Interviews"
    - "Review Applications"
    - "Finalize Contract"

    ✅ Be consistent with naming patterns
    - "Planning Phase", "Execution Phase", "Review Phase"

    ✅ Keep names short (2-4 words)
    - "Initial Setup"
    - "Final Review"
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Don't">
    ❌ Use vague names
    - "Part 1"
    - "Other Stuff"
    - "Miscellaneous"

    ❌ Include unnecessary words
    - "This is the category for conducting interviews"

    ❌ Use inconsistent patterns
    - "Planning", "Execute the Process", "After We're Done"
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## How Many Categories Should You Have?

There's no perfect number, but here are some guidelines:

| Process Size | Recommended Categories | Example |
|--------------|----------------------|---------|
| Small (5-10 activities) | 2-3 categories | Simple approval process |
| Medium (10-25 activities) | 3-6 categories | Department onboarding |
| Large (25-50 activities) | 5-10 categories | Complex sales cycle |
| Very Large (50+ activities) | Consider splitting into multiple core processes | Full product development lifecycle |

<Warning>
If you need more than 10 categories, your process might be too large. Consider breaking it into multiple smaller core processes instead.
</Warning>

## Examples by Process Type

    3. Review & Adjustment (color: orange)
    4. Management Approval (color: red)
    5. Reporting & Distribution (color: green)

    **Why this works:** Clear stages with red highlighting the critical approval gate.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Editing and Deleting Categories

### Editing a Category

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find the Category">
    Locate the category you want to edit in your process view.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open Edit Menu">
    Click the edit icon (usually a pencil) or three-dot menu next to the category name.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Make Changes">
    Update the name, color, or description as needed.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save">
    Click "Save" to apply your changes. Visual diagrams will update automatically.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Deleting a Category

<Warning>
**Be careful when deleting categories.** Depending on your system, this might:

- Require you to reassign activities first

Always check what will happen before confirming the deletion.
</Warning>

## Tips for Large Processes

If you're working with a process that has many activities:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Start Broad" icon="maximize">
    Begin with high-level categories, then refine as you add activities.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Use Sub-Categories" icon="indent">
    If available, use nested categories for extra organization (e.g., "Interviews > Phone Screen" and "Interviews > Final Round").
  </Card>
  <Card title="Review Regularly" icon="rotate">
    As your process evolves, review whether your categories still make sense.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Get Feedback" icon="comments">
    Ask team members if the categories make the process easier to understand.
