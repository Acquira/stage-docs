## What Are Forms?

Forms are fillable documents or templates that team members complete as part of an activity. By attaching forms directly to your activity guides, you ensure people have the right forms at the right time.

Forms can include checklists, request forms, data collection templates, approval documents, or any other structured information that needs to be completed.

<Info>
Forms complement your activity guides. The guide tells people what to do; the form gives them a structured way to capture information.

    - **Word/Google Docs** templates
    - **Excel/Google Sheets** spreadsheets
    - **Online forms** (Google Forms, Typeform, etc.)

    Make sure the form includes:

    - Instructions for completing it
    - Required field indicators (*)
    - Submission instructions
  </Step>

  <Step title="Open Your Activity Guide">
    Navigate to the activity guide where you want to attach the form.

    Click "Edit" to open the guide editor.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Navigate to the Forms Section">
    Find where you want to reference the form in your instructions.

    Look for an "Attach Form" button, "Upload" option, or simply the place in your instructions where the form should be mentioned.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Upload or Link the Form">
    Depending on your system:
    - **Upload:** Click "Attach Form" and upload the file from your computer
    - **Link:** Paste the URL to an online form or document
    - **Embed:** Some systems let you embed forms directly in the guide

    Add a descriptive name for the form so users know what it is.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Reference the Form in Instructions">
    In your step-by-step instructions, tell users when and how to complete the form.

    **Example:**
    > **Step 4: Complete the Budget Request Form**
    > Download and fill out the Budget Request Form (attached below). Complete all required fields marked with (*). Save the completed form as: YourName_BudgetRequest_YYYY-MM-DD.pdf

    Try filling it out to ensure all fields are accessible and instructions are clear.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save Your Guide">
    Click "Save" to publish your guide with the attached form.

    Team members can now access the form directly from the activity guide.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Form Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Keep Forms Simple" icon="minimize" defaultOpen>
    **Why:** Long, complex forms discourage completion and increase errors.

    **How:**
    - Only include necessary fields
    - Use dropdowns instead of text fields when possible
    - Group related fields into sections
    - Use clear, simple labels

    **Example:** Instead of "Please provide detailed information about your request including justification, expected outcomes, timeline, and budget implications," break this into separate, clearly labeled fields.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Mark Required Fields" icon="asterisk">
    **Why:** Users need to know what's mandatory vs. optional.

    **How:**
    - Use asterisks (*) for required fields
    - Include a note at the top: "* indicates required field"
    - Consider using form validation that prevents submission without required fields

    **Tip:** Only mark fields as required if they're truly necessary. Over-requiring creates frustration.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Provide Instructions" icon="circle-info">
    **Why:** Clear instructions reduce errors and questions.

    **How:**
    - Add brief instructions at the top of the form
    - Include field-level help text for complex fields
    - Provide examples for format-specific fields (dates, phone numbers)
    - Link to additional resources if needed

    **Example for a date field:** "Enter start date (format: MM/DD/YYYY, e.g., 06/15/2024)"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Consistent Formatting" icon="equals">
    **Why:** Consistency makes forms easier to scan and complete.

    **How:**
    - Use the same font and sizing throughout
    - Align fields consistently
    - Use consistent spacing
    - Match your company's document branding

    Create form templates that everyone uses to maintain consistency.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Include Submission Instructions" icon="paper-plane">
    **Why:** Users need to know what to do after completing the form.

    **How:**
    - State where to submit (email, portal, folder, etc.)
    - Specify who receives it
    - Mention any deadlines
    - Note what happens next

    **Example:** "Submit completed form to approvals@company.com. Your manager will review within 2 business days. You'll receive an email when approved."
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Creating Effective Forms

<Steps>
  <Step title="Define the Purpose">
    What information do you need to collect? Why?

    Write down the specific data points required and why each one matters.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Design the Form Structure">
    Organize fields into logical sections:
    - Group related information together
    - Put most important fields first
    - End with submission information

    **Example structure for a budget request:**
    1. Requestor Information (name, dept, date)
    2. Request Details (amount, category, purpose)
    3. Justification (why needed, expected outcomes)
    4. Approvals (manager signature, date)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose Field Types">
    Select the appropriate input type for each field:
    - **Text fields:** For names, descriptions
    - **Dropdowns:** For predefined options
    - **Radio buttons:** For single choice from options
    - **Checkboxes:** For multiple selections
    - **Date pickers:** For dates
    - **Number fields:** For amounts

    Use constrained inputs (dropdowns, radio buttons) when possible to ensure data consistency.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Validation">
    If using online forms, add validation rules:
    - Required fields can't be blank
    - Email fields must contain "@"
    - Number fields only accept numbers
    - Dates must be valid formats

    Validation prevents submission of incomplete or incorrect data.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test the Form">
    Fill out the form yourself from a user's perspective:
    - Are any questions confusing?
    - Are there too many required fields?
    - Is anything missing?
    - Does it take too long to complete?

    Get feedback from team members before finalizing.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Form Naming Conventions

Use clear, consistent naming for forms:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Form Files" icon="file">
    **Pattern:** FormPurpose_Version_Date

    **Examples:**
    - BudgetRequest_v2.0_2024-06.pdf
    - InterviewScorecard_v1.3_2024-01.xlsx
    - OnboardingChecklist_v3.0_2024-03.docx
  </Card>
  <Card title="Completed Forms" icon="file-check">
    **Pattern:** YourName_FormType_Date

    **Examples:**

    - MikeC_ExpenseReport_2024-06.xlsx
    - Project_Alpha_Kickoff_2024-06-10.docx
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Version Control for Forms

Forms evolve over time. Track versions properly:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Version Number">
    Include version number in the form itself (header or footer).

    Use semantic versioning: v1.0, v1.1 (minor changes), v2.0 (major changes)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Update Date">
    Show when the form was last updated.

    Format: "Last updated: June 2024" or "Version 2.0 - June 2024"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Update the Attached Form">
    When you update a form, replace the old version in all guides that use it.

    Check where the form is used before updating to avoid breaking workflows in progress.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Notify Users">
    When you make significant changes, notify team members who use the form.

    Explain what changed and why in a brief email or message.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
**Don't create multiple versions of the same form.** If you have BudgetRequest_v1.pdf and BudgetRequest_v2.pdf both active, people will use the wrong version. Retire old versions when you update forms.
</Warning>
