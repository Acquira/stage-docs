## What Are Blueprints?

Blueprints are category-level documents that provide context, background, and overview for a group of related activities. They explain the "why" behind your activities and provide important information that applies to the entire category.

Think of blueprints as the introduction to a chapter in a book. They set the stage before diving into the specific activity details.

<Info>
Blueprints are optional. Only create them when your category needs context or explanation that doesn't fit at the activity level.

## When to Create Blueprints

Create blueprints when your category:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Needs Context" icon="lightbulb">
    Team members need to understand the purpose or rationale behind these activities
  </Card>
  <Card title="Has Policies" icon="scale-balanced">
    Important rules, compliance requirements, or guidelines apply to all activities
  </Card>
  <Card title="Requires Training" icon="graduation-cap">
    New team members need background before performing the activities
  </Card>
  <Card title="Is Complex" icon="gears">
    The category involves multiple interconnected activities that need explanation
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Warning>
Don't create blueprints for every category. Only create them when the category truly needs explanation. Simple, self-explanatory categories don't need blueprints.
</Warning>

## Accessing the Blueprint Editor

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Process Flow">
    Go to your core process and click the **Visual** tab to see the Process Flow diagram.

    This view shows all your categories as colored horizontal bars with activities beneath them.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Find Your Category">
    Locate the category you want to document. Each category appears as a colored bar (red, green, blue, etc.) with the category name on the left.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click the Blueprint Button">
    On the right side of the category bar, click the **"Blueprint"** button.

    This opens the Blueprint editor for that category.
  </Step>
</Steps>

</Tip>

## Creating Your First Blueprint

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Blueprint Editor">
    Follow the steps above to access the Blueprint editor for your category.

    You'll see the empty editor with "Start typing..." placeholder text.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start with a Clear Structure">
    Begin by outlining the main sections you want to include. Use headings to organize your content.

    Common sections include:
    - Purpose & Objectives
    - Overview & Context
    - Key Policies & Guidelines
    - Tools & Resources
    - Roles & Responsibilities
  </Step>

  <Step title="Write Your Content">
    Use the rich text editor to document the key information for this category.

    Focus on category-level information that applies to all activities in this group, not specific step-by-step procedures.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Format for Readability">
    Use the formatting toolbar to:
    - Add headings to create clear sections
    - Use bullet points for lists
    - Bold important terms or concepts
    - Add links to related resources
    - Include tables for structured information

    Good formatting makes blueprints much easier to scan and understand.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Comments (Optional)">
    Click **"Add Comment"** to leave notes or questions for team members.

    Comments are useful when collaborating on blueprint documentation.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save Your Blueprint">
    Once you've documented the essential information, save your work.

    The system will create version 1.0 and add it to the Version History.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What to Include in Your Blueprint

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="1. Purpose & Objectives" icon="bullseye" defaultOpen>
    Start with why. Explain what this category accomplishes and why it matters to the overall process.

    **Example for "Purchase Approval":**
    > **Common Scenarios**
    >
    > **Q: What if I need approval urgently?**
    > A: For urgent requests (needed within 24 hours), email your approver directly and CC their assistant. Mark email as "URGENT." Still submit the formal request in the system.
    >
    > **Q: What if my approver is out of office?**
    > A: Check their OOO message for their designated backup approver. If none listed, contact your department's operations manager.
    >
    > **Q: Can I split a large purchase into smaller requests to avoid CFO approval?**
    > A: No. This violates policy. Always submit the full purchase amount in one request.

    This section grows over time as you encounter common questions.

    Break content into sections with descriptive headings so people can scan quickly.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Be Concise" icon="minimize">

## Blueprint Examples by Category Type

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Approval Category">
    **Category:** Budget Approval - Requests Over $25K

    **Blueprint Content:**

## Version History and Updates

MPQA automatically tracks versions of your blueprints:

### How Versions Work

**Initial save:**
- Creates version 1.0
- Appears in Version History sidebar
- Metadata shows creation date and author

**Subsequent saves:**
- Each save creates a new version
- Versions are numbered automatically
- You can view any previous version by clicking it in the sidebar

**Viewing past versions:**
- Click any version in the Version History sidebar
- The editor displays that version's content
- You can copy content from old versions if needed

<Tip>
Use the Version History to track how your blueprint has evolved over time and to recover accidentally deleted content.
</Tip>

## Best Practices

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start with an Outline">
    List the sections you need before writing. This prevents rambling and ensures you cover everything important.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Get Input from Team">
    Ask team members what context or information would be helpful for this category. They know what's confusing or unclear.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use Real Examples">
    Provide concrete examples rather than abstract concepts. Examples make blueprints much easier to understand.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Link to Activity Guides">
    Reference specific activity guides when relevant. Blueprints and guides work together to provide complete documentation.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Keep It Current">
    Review and update blueprints when processes, policies, or tools change. Set calendar reminders for regular reviews.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Common Blueprint Mistakes

<Warning>
**Too Much Detail**

Blueprints should be high-level overviews, not step-by-step manuals. If you're documenting every click and button press, you're writing an activity guide, not a blueprint.
</Warning>

<Warning>
**Duplicating Content**

Don't copy your process SOP into your blueprint or repeat information from activity guides. Each documentation level has its purpose. Link between them instead of duplicating.
</Warning>

<Warning>
**Creating Unnecessary Blueprints**

Not every category needs a blueprint. Simple, self-explanatory categories don't benefit from additional documentation. Only create blueprints when they add real value.
</Warning>

<Warning>
**Forgetting to Update**

When policies change, tools change, or roles change, update your blueprints. Outdated information is worse than no information because it misleads people.
</Warning>

## Blueprint Checklist

Before considering your blueprint complete:

- Clear structure with descriptive headings
- Purpose and objectives clearly stated
- Context provided for how this category fits in the process
- Key policies and guidelines documented
- Tools and resources listed with working links
- Roles and responsibilities clarified
- Success criteria or metrics defined (if applicable)
- Common scenarios or FAQs addressed
- Proper formatting for readability
- Reviewed by team members who use this category
- Free of typos and grammatical errors

## Tips for Success

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Focus on Context" icon="lightbulb">
    Explain why things are done this way, not just what to do. The "why" is what makes blueprints valuable.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Use Visuals" icon="image">
    Add diagrams, flowcharts, or screenshots when they clarify complex concepts or relationships.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Be Strategic" icon="chess">
    Only create blueprints that add real value. Don't document for the sake of documentation.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Gather Feedback" icon="comments">
    After creating the blueprint, ask team members if it helps them understand the category better. Update based on their feedback.
