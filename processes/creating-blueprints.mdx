## What Are Blueprints?

Blueprints are category-level documents that provide context, background, and overview for a group of related activities. They explain the "why" behind your activities and provide important information that applies to the entire category.

Think of blueprints as the introduction to a chapter in a book. They set the stage before diving into the details.

<Info>
Blueprints are optional. Only create them when your category needs context or explanation that doesn't fit at the activity level.

## When to Create Blueprints

Create blueprints when your category:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Needs Context" icon="lightbulb">
    Team members need to understand the purpose or rationale behind these activities
  </Card>
  <Card title="Has Policies" icon="scale-balanced">
    Important rules, compliance requirements, or guidelines apply to all activities
  </Card>
  <Card title="Requires Training" icon="graduation-cap">
    New team members need background before performing the activities
  </Card>
  <Card title="Is Complex" icon="gears">
    The category involves multiple interconnected activities that need explanation
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Warning>
**Don't create blueprints for every category.** Only create them when the category truly needs explanation. Simple, self-explanatory categories don't need blueprints.
</Warning>

## Creating Your First Blueprint

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Your Category">
    Open the core process containing the category you want to document.

    Find the category in your list of categories.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Open Category Details">
    Click on the category name or click the settings/options icon next to it.

    Look for a "Blueprint," "Documentation," or "Details" option.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click Create Blueprint">
    Click the **"Create Blueprint"** or **"Add Documentation"** button.

    If a blueprint already exists, you'll see an "Edit" option instead.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add a Title">
    Your blueprint title should match your category name or clearly reference it.

    **Examples:**
    - "Candidate Screening - Overview and Guidelines"
    - "First Week Training Blueprint"
    - "Budget Approval Process Guide"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Write Your Content">
    Document the key information for this category. Include:
    - Purpose and objectives
    - Context and background
    - Key policies or guidelines
    - Tools and resources
    - Success criteria

    Use the rich text editor to format your content clearly.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review and Save">
    Read through your blueprint. Does it help someone understand this category better?

    Click **"Save"** to publish your blueprint.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What to Include in Your Blueprint

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="1. Purpose & Objectives" icon="bullseye" defaultOpen>
    **Start with why.** Explain what this category accomplishes and why it matters.

    **Example for "Candidate Screening":**

    >
    > **Objectives**
    > - Screen 100% of applications within 48 hours
    > - Identify qualified candidates for phone screens
    > - Maintain consistent evaluation standards

    >
    > **When This Applies**
    > This approval process covers all non-payroll expenses including software, equipment, consulting, marketing, and travel. Payroll and capital expenditures follow separate processes (see links).

    **Example for "Purchase Approval":**
    > **Common Scenarios**
    >
    > **Q: What if I need approval urgently?**
    > A: For urgent requests (needed within 24 hours), email your approver directly and CC their assistant. Mark email as "URGENT." Still submit the formal request in the system.
    >
    > **Q: What if my approver is out of office?**
    > A: Check their OOO message for their designated backup approver. If none listed, contact your department's operations manager.
    >
    > **Q: Can I split a large purchase into smaller requests to avoid CFO approval?**
    > A: No. This violates policy. Always submit the full purchase amount in one request.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Keep It High-Level" icon="mountain">
    Blueprints provide context, not step-by-step instructions. Save detailed procedures for activity guides.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Use Clear Headings" icon="heading">
    Break content into sections with descriptive headings so people can scan quickly.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Be Concise" icon="minimize">
    Short paragraphs (2-3 sentences) are easier to read than long blocks of text.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Link Generously" icon="link">
    Link to related resources, guides, forms, and documentation rather than duplicating information.

    **Category:** Budget Approval - Requests Over $25K

    > 3. Social posts third (spread throughout day)
    > 4. Paid ads activate last (after confirming others work)
    >
    > **Monitoring During Launch**

## Best Practices

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start with an Outline">
    List the sections you need before writing. This prevents rambling and ensures you cover everything.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Get Input from Team">
    Ask team members what context or information would be helpful. They know what's confusing or unclear.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use Real Examples">
    Provide concrete examples rather than abstract concepts. Examples make blueprints much easier to understand.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Link to Activity Guides">
    Reference specific activity guides when relevant. Blueprints and guides work together.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Keep It Current">
    Review blueprints when processes change. Outdated blueprints cause confusion.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Common Blueprint Mistakes

<Warning>
**Too Much Detail**

Blueprints should be high-level overviews, not step-by-step manuals. If you're documenting every click, you're writing a guide, not a blueprint.
</Warning>

<Warning>
**Duplicating SOP Content**

Don't copy your SOP into your blueprint. Blueprints are category-specific. SOPs cover the entire process. Link between them instead.
</Warning>

<Warning>
**Creating Blueprints That Aren't Needed**

Not every category needs a blueprint. Simple, self-explanatory categories don't benefit from additional documentation.
</Warning>

<Warning>
**Forgetting to Update**

When policies change or tools change, update your blueprints. Outdated information is worse than no information.
</Warning>

## Version Control

Track changes to your blueprints:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Version Numbering" icon="list-ol" defaultOpen>
    Mark your blueprint with version numbers:
    - **1.0** - Initial version
    - **1.1, 1.2** - Minor updates (clarifications, small additions)
    - **2.0, 3.0** - Major updates (significant changes to policies or structure)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Revision History" icon="clock-rotate-left">
    Keep a simple log of changes:

    | Version | Date | Author | Changes |
    |---------|------|--------|---------|
    | 1.0 | Jan 2024 | Sarah J. | Initial blueprint |
    | 1.1 | Mar 2024 | Mike C. | Added FAQ section |
    | 2.0 | Jun 2024 | Sarah J. | Updated approval thresholds |
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Review Schedule" icon="calendar">
    Set a reminder to review blueprints:
    - **Quarterly:** For rapidly changing categories
    - **Semi-annually:** For moderately stable categories
    - **Annually:** For very stable categories
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
