## Accessing Shared Processes

When someone shares a process with you, you get access to view it, use it as a reference, and (depending on your permissions) contribute to it.

Shared processes appear in a dedicated section of your workspace, making it easy to find documentation that's relevant to your work.

<Info>
Processes shared with you don't clutter your personal workspace. They live in a separate "Shared With Me" section that you can access whenever needed.
</Info>

## Finding Shared Processes

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Shared With Me Section">
    **The dedicated shared processes area**

    Navigate to **"Shared With Me"** in your main navigation or dashboard.

    You'll see all processes that others have shared with you, organized by:
    - Recently shared
    - Process name
    - Who shared it
    - Your permission level
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Notifications">
    **When someone shares a process**

    You receive a notification (email and/or in-app) containing:
    - Who shared it
    - Process name
    - Direct link to open it
    - Your permission level
    - Optional message from the sharer

    Click the link to go directly to the process.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Search">
    **Find processes by name or content**

    Use the search function to find shared processes.

    Search looks through:
    - Process names
    - Activity names
    - Documentation content
    - RACI assignments

    Results show both your processes and shared processes.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Direct Links">
    **When someone sends you a link**

    Team members might send you a direct link via email, chat, or documentation.

    Click the link to open the process. If you have permission, you'll see the full content.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Understanding Your Access Level

When viewing a shared process, check your permission level to know what you can do:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="View" icon="eye" color="#3b82f6">
    You can see and reference the process but can't change or comment
  </Card>
  <Card title="Comment" icon="message" color="#10b981">
    You can see the process and add comments or suggestions
  </Card>
  <Card title="Edit" icon="pen" color="#f59e0b">
    You can make changes to the process and its documentation
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

Your permission level usually appears:
- At the top of the process view
- In the "Shared With Me" list
- In the process header or sidebar

Learn more: [Permission Levels](/processes/permission-levels)

## Using Shared Processes as Reference

Most commonly, you'll use shared processes as reference while doing your work:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Process">
    Navigate to the shared process from your "Shared With Me" section or click a link.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Find Your Activity">
    Locate the activity you're working on. Use:
    - Table of contents
    - Category navigation
    - Search within the process
    - Visual diagram to see the flow
  </Step>

  <Step title="Read the Instructions">
    Review the activity details:
    - What needs to be done
    - Your RACI role
    - Step-by-step guide (if available)
    - Forms or templates needed
  </Step>

  <Step title="Follow the Process">
    Complete your work according to the documented procedure.

    Keep the process open for reference as you work.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Check Off Completion">
    Some systems let you mark activities as complete (depending on your permission level and system features).
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
**Pro tip:** Bookmark frequently used shared processes for quick access. Most systems let you favorite or star processes so they appear at the top of your list.
</Tip>

## Adding Comments to Shared Processes

If you have Comment or Edit permission, you can add feedback:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to What Needs Feedback">
    Find the activity, documentation section, or RACI assignment you want to comment on.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click Add Comment">
    Look for a comment icon, "Add Comment" button, or comment field.

    Different systems place this in different locations (sidebar, inline, popup).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Write Your Comment">
    Be specific and constructive:
    - Reference exactly what you're commenting on
    - Explain the issue or suggestion
    - Propose a solution if possible
    - Tag relevant people with @mentions

    **Good comment:** "In Step 3, the link to the form template is broken. The correct link is [URL]. @Sarah can you update?"

    **Poor comment:** "This doesn't work."
  </Step>

  <Step title="Post Your Comment">
    Click "Post," "Submit," or "Comment" to add your feedback.

    People with access to the process (especially those with Edit permission) will see your comment and can respond.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Follow Up">
    Check back for responses to your comment.

    Some systems notify you when someone replies.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Comment Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Be Specific" icon="bullseye">
    Point to exactly what needs attention. Don't make vague comments.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Be Constructive" icon="thumbs-up">
    Frame feedback positively. Suggest improvements rather than just complaining.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Tag People" icon="at">
    Use @mentions to notify the right people about your comment.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Include Context" icon="info-circle">
    Explain why something is an issue or how your suggestion helps.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Comment Examples

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Good Comments">
    ✅ "The email template link in Step 4 returns a 404 error. I found the updated template here: [link]. @Mike can you update the guide?"

    ✅ "In my experience, calling customers before sending the cancellation email (Step 2) reduces churn by about 30%. Should we add a phone call step before the email?"

    ✅ "Great documentation! One suggestion: can we add a screenshot in Step 6 showing where to find the Export button? New team members always ask about this."

    ✅ "The RACI shows Sarah as Accountable, but she left the company last month. @TeamLead who should be the new owner?"
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Poor Comments">
    ❌ "This is wrong." (Not specific, not helpful)

    ❌ "I don't like this process." (No explanation, no suggestion)

    ❌ "Update this." (No context about what or why)

    ❌ "?????" (Not helpful at all)

    ❌ "Someone needs to fix Step 3." (Who? What's wrong with it?)
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Editing Shared Processes

If you have Edit permission, you can make changes directly:

### Making Small Edits

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Edit Mode">
    Click "Edit" or the edit icon for the section you want to change.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Make Your Changes">
    Update the content, activity, or assignment as needed.

    For small fixes (typos, broken links, minor clarifications), go ahead and edit.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save Your Changes">
    Click "Save" to apply your edits.

    Changes are visible immediately to everyone with access.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Notify if Needed">
    For significant changes, notify the process owner or team via comment or message.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Making Large Changes

<Warning>
**Before making major changes:**
- Discuss with the process owner first
- Add a comment explaining your proposed changes
- Get agreement from the team
- Make changes when others aren't actively editing

**Major changes include:**
- Reordering activities
- Removing content
- Changing RACI assignments
- Restructuring categories
- Rewriting documentation
</Warning>

## Collaborating Effectively

When working with shared processes as a team:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Respect the Process Owner" icon="handshake" defaultOpen>
    The process owner is responsible for maintaining quality and consistency.

    **Do:**
    - Check with them before major changes
    - Support their decisions about structure
    - Offer to help with updates
    - Communicate about your edits

    **Don't:**
    - Make sweeping changes without discussion
    - Override their decisions repeatedly
    - Delete their work without agreement
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Communicate Your Edits" icon="comments">
    Let others know what you're changing and why.

    **For Edit permission holders:**
    - Add a comment explaining significant changes
    - Notify the team via email or chat for major updates
    - Document your reasoning
    - Be open to feedback

    **Example:** "I updated Step 4 to reflect our new CRM system. Old instructions no longer apply. Let me know if you see any issues."
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Avoid Edit Conflicts" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    When multiple people edit simultaneously, conflicts can occur.

    **To avoid:**
    - Check who else is viewing/editing before starting
    - Make your edits in one session, don't leave it half-done
    - Save frequently
    - Communicate if you're making extensive edits

    Some systems lock sections being edited or show who's currently editing.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Comments for Discussion" icon="message">
    Comments are great for discussion and questions.

    **Good uses:**
    - Ask why something is done a certain way
    - Propose improvements before implementing
    - Point out issues you're not sure how to fix
    - Start conversations about process changes

    **Example:** "I noticed we're not tracking lead source in Step 2. Should we add that? @SalesManager what do you think?"
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Organizing Shared Processes

Keep your "Shared With Me" section organized:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Bookmark Favorites" icon="star">
    Star or favorite the processes you use most often for quick access
  </Card>
  <Card title="Create Folders" icon="folder">
    If your system supports it, organize shared processes into folders by function or frequency
  </Card>
  <Card title="Hide Unused" icon="eye-slash">
    Archive or hide processes you no longer need but still have access to
  </Card>
  <Card title="Use Search" icon="magnifying-glass">
    Don't scroll endlessly. Use search to find what you need quickly
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Notifications for Shared Processes

Manage your notifications to stay informed without being overwhelmed:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="What You're Notified About">
    Typically you receive notifications when:
    - A new process is shared with you
    - Someone comments on a process you have access to
    - Someone replies to your comment
    - Someone @mentions you
    - Major changes are made to processes you use
    - Your permission level changes
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Notification Settings">
    Most systems let you control notification preferences:
    - Immediate email for each event
    - Daily digest of activity
    - In-app only (no emails)
    - Only @mentions and replies
    - No notifications

    Find these in your account settings or preferences.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Process-Specific Settings">
    Some systems let you customize notifications per process:
    - "Watch" processes you care about
    - "Mute" processes that aren't relevant
    - Choose notification frequency
    - Subscribe to specific comment threads

    This lets you stay updated on important processes without drowning in notifications from less relevant ones.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Requesting Access to Processes

If you need access to a process you can't see:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find Out Who Owns It">
    Ask your team lead, manager, or colleagues who owns or maintains the process.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Request Access">
    Contact the process owner directly:
    - Explain why you need access
    - Specify what permission level you need (View, Comment, or Edit)
    - Mention how you'll use it

    **Example:** "Hi Sarah, I'm working on the customer onboarding process and need to reference your customer data collection procedures. Can you share the 'Data Collection Process' with me (View permission is fine)?"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Wait for Approval">
    The owner will review your request and grant access if appropriate.

    You'll receive a notification when access is granted.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Some systems have a "Request Access" button on processes you can see but can't open. Click it to send an automatic access request to the owner.
</Tip>

## Removing Yourself from Shared Processes

If you no longer need access to a shared process:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Process">
    Navigate to the shared process you want to leave.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Find Remove/Leave Option">
    Look for "Remove me," "Leave," or "Stop sharing with me" in the share settings or options menu.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Confirm Removal">
    Confirm that you want to remove yourself.

    The process disappears from your "Shared With Me" section.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
**Or just leave it:** Many people keep shared processes even if they rarely use them. It doesn't hurt to have access to processes you might need someday. Only remove yourself if it's truly cluttering your workspace.
</Note>

## Tips for Success

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Check Updates Regularly" icon="clock-rotate-left">

    **What to do:**
    1. Document how you actually do things in a comment
    2. Ask if the process needs updating or if you should change your approach
    3. Work with the process owner to align documentation with reality
