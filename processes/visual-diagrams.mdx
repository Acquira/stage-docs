## Automatic Diagram Generation

The Business Process Framework automatically generates visual diagrams for every core process you create. You don't need to use complicated diagramming software or manually draw anything.

As you add activities and assign RACI roles, the system creates beautiful, professional diagrams that you can share with your team or export for presentations.

<Tip>
The diagrams update in real-time as you edit your process. Make a change, and watch the diagram reflect it instantly.
</Tip>

## Two Types of Diagrams

The system generates two different diagram views, each serving a different purpose:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Visual Diagram" icon="diagram-project" color="#3b82f6">
    A flowchart-style diagram showing the sequence of activities and their relationships.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Swimlane Diagram" icon="table-columns" color="#10b981">
    A diagram organized by roles, showing which team members are responsible for which activities.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Visual Diagram Tab

The Visual Diagram shows your process as a flowchart, making it easy to understand the sequence of activities.

### What You'll See

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Activity Boxes" icon="square" defaultOpen>
    Each activity appears as a box in the diagram. The boxes show:
    - Activity name
    - Category color coding
    - Sequential order

    Activities are arranged from top to bottom or left to right, showing the flow of work.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Color Coding" icon="palette">
    Activities are color-coded based on their categories, making it easy to see how your process is organized.

    You'll instantly recognize which activities belong to which phase or category of your process.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Flow Connections" icon="arrows-turn-to-dots">
    Arrows or lines connect activities, showing the flow from one step to the next.

    This makes it easy to understand dependencies and sequence.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Best For

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Understanding Sequence" icon="arrow-down-1-9">
    Perfect for seeing what happens first, second, third in your process.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Identifying Gaps" icon="circle-exclamation">
    Helps you spot missing steps or unnecessary activities.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Training" icon="chalkboard-user">
    Great for teaching new team members how the process flows.
  </Card>
  <Card title="High-Level Overview" icon="eye">
    Gives stakeholders a quick understanding of the entire process.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Swimlane Diagram Tab

The Swimlane Diagram organizes activities by roles, showing who does what. Think of it like lanes in a swimming pool, each lane represents a different role or team member.

### What You'll See

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Role Lanes" icon="water" defaultOpen>
    The diagram is divided into horizontal "lanes," one for each RACI role in your process.

    Each lane shows all the activities that person or role is involved in.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Activities in Lanes" icon="box">
    Activities appear in the lane of the person who is **Responsible** for that activity.

    This makes it crystal clear who does what work.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Cross-Lane Connections" icon="arrow-right-arrow-left">
    Arrows show when work moves from one role to another.

    For example, when the recruiter finishes screening and hands off to the hiring manager for interviews.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="RACI Indicators" icon="user-tag">
    Small indicators show if someone is Accountable, Consulted, or Informed for activities in other lanes.

    You can see not just who does the work, but who approves it or provides input.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Best For

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Understanding Roles" icon="users">
    Perfect for seeing all the work a specific person or role does in the process.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Identifying Handoffs" icon="hand-holding">
    Shows where work transfers between team members, highlighting potential bottlenecks.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Workload Balance" icon="scale-balanced">
    Helps you see if one person has too much or too little responsibility.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Team Discussions" icon="comments">
    Great for reviewing processes with your team to ensure everyone understands their role.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Diagram Tips and Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Keep It Simple" icon="minimize">
    If your diagram looks too complex, consider breaking your process into smaller core processes.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Use Color Wisely" icon="droplet">
    Choose distinct colors for your activity categories so they're easy to distinguish in diagrams.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Review with Your Team" icon="users">
    Share diagrams in team meetings to validate that everyone understands the process.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Update After Changes" icon="rotate">
    After editing your process, review the diagrams to ensure they still make sense visually.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Troubleshooting Diagrams

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Diagram looks cluttered" icon="explosion">
    **Solution:** Your process might have too many activities. Consider:
    - Breaking it into multiple smaller core processes
    - Combining similar activities
    - Simplifying your categories
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can't see all activities" icon="eye-slash">
    **Solution:** Zoom out using your mouse wheel or pinch gesture. Large processes create large diagrams.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Swimlane has too many lanes" icon="list">
    **Solution:** You might have too many different roles in one process. Consider:
    - Grouping similar roles
    - Creating separate processes for different teams
    - Reviewing if all RACI assignments are necessary
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Export quality is poor" icon="image">
    **Solution:** Choose PDF format for the highest quality, especially for large diagrams. PDFs scale better than PNGs.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## When to Use Each Diagram

| Use Case | Visual Diagram | Swimlane Diagram |
|----------|----------------|------------------|
| Training new team members | ✅ Great | ⚠️ Can be confusing |
| Showing process flow | ✅ Perfect | ❌ Not ideal |
| Clarifying roles | ⚠️ Limited | ✅ Perfect |
| Identifying bottlenecks | ⚠️ Okay | ✅ Excellent |
| Executive presentations | ✅ Great | ⚠️ Too detailed |
| Team collaboration | ✅ Good | ✅ Great |
| Finding workload issues | ❌ Not useful | ✅ Perfect |

<Note>
**Pro tip:** Use the Visual diagram for understanding the process, and the Swimlane diagram for understanding the people.
</Note>
