## Why Share Processes?

Process documentation is most valuable when shared with the people who need it. Sharing ensures your team can access the processes, contribute improvements, and maintain consistency across your organization.

When you share a process, team members can view it, use it as a reference, and (depending on permissions) contribute to it.

<Info>
Sharing makes your processes collaborative instead of isolated. The best process documentation is created and maintained by the entire team, not just one person.
</Info>

## What Can Be Shared?

You can share different levels of your process hierarchy:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Core Processes" icon="sitemap">
    Share an entire process with all its activities, categories, and documentation
  </Card>
  <Card title="Individual Activities" icon="list-check">
    Share specific activities if you don't want to share the whole process
  </Card>
  <Card title="Documentation" icon="file-lines">
    Share SOPs, guides, or blueprints separately from the process structure
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Note>
Most commonly, you'll share entire core processes. This gives team members access to everything they need in one place.
</Note>

## How to Share a Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Process">
    Navigate to the core process you want to share.

    You must be the process owner or have permission to share it.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Find the Share Button">
    In your core process view (RACI tab, Visual tab, or any other tab), look for the **"Share"** button in the top toolbar.

    The Share button appears near other action buttons like SOP, RACI, Visual, Swimlane, and KPIs.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click Share">
    Click the Share button to open the sharing dialog.

    You'll see options for adding people and setting permissions.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Team Members">
    Type names or email addresses to find team members.

    Select each person you want to share with. You can add multiple people at once.

    **Options for adding people:**
    - Add individuals by name
    - Add entire teams or departments (if your system supports groups)
    - Share with everyone in your organization
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Permission Levels">
    For each person or group, choose their permission level:
    - **View:** Can see the process but can't edit
    - **Comment:** Can view and add comments/suggestions
    - **Edit:** Can make changes to the process

    Learn more: [Permission Levels](/processes/permission-levels)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add a Message (Optional)">
    Some systems let you include a message with the share notification.

    **Example:** "Hi team, here's the updated onboarding process. Please review and let me know if anything is unclear."

    This context helps recipients understand why they're receiving access.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Send Invitations">
    Click **"Share"** or **"Send"** to grant access.

    Team members will receive a notification (email or in-app) that the process has been shared with them.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Choosing Who to Share With

Think strategically about sharing:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Share with Direct Users" icon="user" defaultOpen>
    **Who:** People who perform activities in this process

    **Permission:** View or Edit (depending on whether you want them to update documentation)

    **Example:** Share the "Customer Support Process" with all support team members so they can reference procedures while handling tickets.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Share with Stakeholders" icon="briefcase">
    **Who:** Managers, executives, or cross-functional partners who need visibility

    **Permission:** View or Comment

    **Example:** Share the "Sales Process" with the marketing team so they understand lead handoff procedures. They can view and comment but not edit.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Share with Contributors" icon="pen-to-square">
    **Who:** Subject matter experts or team leads who help maintain documentation

    **Permission:** Edit

    **Example:** Share the "HR Onboarding Process" with the HR manager and senior recruiters so they can update procedures as things change.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Share with Trainees" icon="graduation-cap">
    **Who:** New employees or team members learning the process

    **Permission:** View only

    **Example:** Share relevant processes with new hires during onboarding. They can read and learn but can't accidentally change anything.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Share Organization-Wide" icon="building">
    **Who:** Everyone in the company

    **Permission:** View (usually)

    **Example:** Share core company processes like "Expense Reimbursement" or "Time Off Requests" with everyone since they apply universally.

    **Caution:** Only share broadly for processes that truly apply to everyone. Too much sharing creates noise.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Sharing Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Share Early" icon="clock">
    Share processes while building them, not after they're "perfect." Early feedback improves quality.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Share Appropriately" icon="shield">
    Don't share sensitive processes (HR, finance, legal) with people who don't need access.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Explain Why" icon="message">
    When sharing, include context about why this process matters to the recipient.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Set Clear Permissions" icon="key">
    Be intentional about edit vs. view permissions. Too many editors creates chaos.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Share Settings and Options

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Individual Sharing">
    **Add specific people one at a time**

    **Best for:**

    **Make visible to everyone in your company**

    **Best for:**
    - Company-wide policies
    - Universal procedures
    - Process transparency

    **Example:** Share "How to Submit an IT Support Ticket" with everyone.

    **Warning:** Only use for truly universal processes. Over-sharing creates information overload.

</Warning>

## Sharing Notifications

When you share a process, the system typically sends notifications:

<AccordionGroup>

    **Email usually includes:**
    - Who shared it
    - Process name and description

    - Link to view the process
    - Optional message from you

    Team members can click the link to access the process immediately.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="In-App Notifications" icon="bell">
    Recipients also see a notification inside the application.

    **Notification shows:**
    - New shared process
    - Who shared it
    - Quick link to open it

    This ensures people see the share even if they miss the email.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Notification Preferences" icon="sliders">
    Some systems let users control their notification preferences.

    Recipients can choose:
    - Email for every share
    - Daily digest of shares
    - In-app only

    **Best for:**
    - Quick sharing via chat or email
    - Sharing with team members

## Common Sharing Mistakes

<Warning>
**Over-Sharing**

Don't share every process with everyone "just in case." This creates information overload and makes it hard to find relevant processes.
</Warning>

<Warning>
**Under-Sharing**

Don't hoard process documentation. If people need it to do their jobs, share it. Withholding creates inefficiency.
</Warning>

<Warning>
**Wrong Permissions**

Giving too many people Edit permissions leads to conflicting changes. Limit Edit to process owners and maintainers.
</Warning>

<Warning>
**Forgetting to Update**

When team members join or leave, update process sharing accordingly. Don't leave former employees with access.
</Warning>
