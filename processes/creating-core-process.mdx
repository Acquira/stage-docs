## What You'll Create

A core process is your team's specific implementation of a master process. It's where you document how your business actually operates.

For example, the master process "Recruit and Onboard Employees" might become your core process called "Remote Team Hiring Process" with your company's unique steps and documentation.

<Info>
Core processes are Level 3 in the four-level framework. This is where you'll spend most of your time in the system.
</Info>

## Before You Start

Make sure you know:

- **Which master process** your core process belongs to (e.g., HR, Marketing, Operations)
- **What you're documenting** - Have a clear understanding of the process you want to create
- **Who's involved** - Know which team members will work on this process

<Tip>
Start with a process you know well. Your first core process should be something you're familiar with, not something complicated or unfamiliar.
</Tip>

## Creating Your First Core Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Processes">
    From the main dashboard, click on **Processes** in the left sidebar.

    You'll see the library of all master processes organized by category (Strategic, Core, Enabling).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Find the Right Master Process">
    Browse or search for the master process that best fits what you're trying to document.

    **Examples:**
    - For hiring: Look in "Human Resources"
    - For sales: Look in "Marketing & Sales"
    - For customer support: Look in "Customer Service"

    Click on the master process to open it.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click 'Create Core Process'">
    Inside the master process view, you'll see a button to create a new core process.

    Click **"Create Core Process"** or **"Add Implementation"** (the button text may vary).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Name Your Core Process">
    Give your core process a clear, descriptive name that explains what it covers.

    **Good names:**
    - "Remote Team Onboarding Process"
    - "B2B Lead Qualification Process"
    - "Monthly Financial Close Process"

    **Poor names:**
    - "Process 1"
    - "HR Stuff"
    - "Sales"

    <Warning>
    Keep names under 80 characters. Be specific enough that anyone on your team immediately knows what the process covers.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add a Description">
    Write a brief description (2-4 sentences) explaining:
    - What this process does
    - When it's used
    - Who it's for

    **Example:** "This process covers how we recruit, interview, and onboard new remote employees. It applies to all full-time hires across all departments. The process starts when a position is approved and ends when the new hire completes their first week."
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Process Details (Optional)">
    Some systems let you add additional details like:
    - **Owner:** Who's responsible for this process overall
    - **Department:** Which team owns it
    - **Review frequency:** How often you'll update it

    Fill these in if available, or skip them for now. You can always add them later.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save and Start Building">
    Click **"Create"** or **"Save"** to create your core process.

    You'll be taken to your new core process view where you can start adding categories and activities.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What Happens Next?

After creating your core process, you'll have an empty canvas ready to build on. Your next steps are:

1. **Add activity categories** to organize your activities
2. **Add activities** - the individual steps in your process
3. **Assign RACI roles** to clarify responsibilities
4. **Create documentation** like SOPs, guides, and blueprints
5. **Add KPIs** to track performance

<Info>
Don't worry about making everything perfect right away. You can edit, reorganize, and improve your core process at any time.

## Naming Best Practices

Your core process name is important because it's how you and your team will find and reference it.

  <Card title="Include Context" icon="location-dot">

  <Card title="Avoid Jargon" icon="ban">

  </Card>
  <Card title="Think Searchable" icon="magnifying-glass">

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Description Best Practices

A good description helps others understand your process without having to dig into the details.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What to Include" icon="circle-check" defaultOpen>
    - **Purpose:** What does this process accomplish?
    - **Scope:** What's included and what's not?
    - **Trigger:** When does this process start?
    - **Outcome:** What's the end result?
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What to Avoid" icon="circle-xmark">
    - Listing every single activity (that's what the activities section is for)
    - Technical jargon that only experts understand
    - Vague statements like "This is our HR process"
    - Unnecessary history or context
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Description Examples

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Good Example">
    **Process:** Remote Employee Onboarding

    **Description:** "This process guides the onboarding of all new remote full-time employees from offer acceptance through their first 30 days. It includes IT setup, benefits enrollment, initial training, and check-ins with managers. The process ensures consistent onboarding experiences regardless of department or location."

    ✅ Clear purpose, scope, and outcome
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Poor Example">
    **Process:** Onboarding

    **Description:** "How we onboard people."

    ❌ Too vague, no useful details
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Better Example">
    **Process:** Quarterly Marketing Campaign Planning

    **Description:** "This process outlines how the marketing team plans and launches quarterly campaigns. It starts with campaign ideation in month one of each quarter and ends with campaign launch at the start of the next quarter. The process includes research, creative development, budget approval, and cross-functional coordination with sales."

    ✅ Specific timeline, clear steps, identifies stakeholders
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

<Warning>
**Creating Too Many Core Processes**

Start small. It's better to have a few well-documented core processes than dozens of incomplete ones. Focus on your most important processes first.
</Warning>

<Warning>
**Choosing the Wrong Master Process**

Take time to find the right master process. If you pick the wrong one, your core process will be harder to organize and find later. When in doubt, look at the master process description.
</Warning>

<Warning>
**Being Too Generic**

"Sales Process" doesn't tell anyone much. "Enterprise B2B Sales Process" or "E-commerce Checkout Process" is much clearer. Be specific about what you're documenting.
</Warning>

<Warning>
**Documenting Aspirations Instead of Reality**

Document how you ACTUALLY work, not how you wish you worked. You can improve the process later, but start with reality.
</Warning>

## Tips for Success

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Start Simple" icon="seedling">
    Create the core process first, then build it out gradually. Don't try to do everything at once.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Get Input Early" icon="comments">
    Share your new core process with team members who'll use it. Get their feedback before you build it out.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Use Templates" icon="file-lines">
    If your master process has templates or examples, use them as a starting point.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Document As You Go" icon="pen">
    As you work through real instances of the process, update your documentation with what you learn.

## Your First Core Process Checklist

Before moving on to adding activities, make sure your core process has:

- [ ] A clear, specific name
- [ ] A description that explains purpose, scope, and outcomes
- [ ] The correct master process selection
- [ ] An assigned owner (if required)
- [ ] Department or team assignment (if required)

<Note>
**Remember:** Your core process is never truly "finished." Business processes evolve, and your documentation should too. Start with a solid foundation and improve it over time.
</Note>
