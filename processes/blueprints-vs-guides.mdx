## Two Types of Documentation

The Business Process Framework offers two ways to document your processes:

- **Blueprints** - Category-level documentation that provides context and overview
- **Guides** - Activity-level documentation that provides step-by-step instructions

Both serve different purposes, and you can use one, both, or neither depending on your needs.

<Info>
Think of blueprints as the "why" and guides as the "how." Blueprints explain the big picture; guides explain the specific steps.
</Info>

## Quick Comparison

| Feature | Blueprints | Guides |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| **Scope** | Entire category | Single activity |
| **Purpose** | Context and overview | Step-by-step instructions |
| **Length** | Usually longer | Usually shorter |
| **Audience** | Everyone involved in the category | Person doing the activity |
| **When to use** | Need background or rationale | Need specific instructions |
| **Attached to** | Activity categories | Individual activities |
| **Best for** | Training, onboarding, context | Execution, task completion |

## Blueprints Explained

Blueprints are attached to activity categories and provide high-level documentation for a group of related activities.

### What Blueprints Contain

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Context & Background" icon="book-open" defaultOpen>
    Blueprints explain why this group of activities exists and how it fits into the larger process.

    **Example:** A blueprint for "Candidate Screening" might explain your company's hiring philosophy, what you're looking for in candidates, and how screening impacts overall hiring success.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Overview & Objectives" icon="bullseye">
    What are you trying to accomplish with these activities?

    **Example:** "The goal of candidate screening is to identify the top 10% of applicants who meet our technical requirements and culture fit, reducing interview time while maintaining quality."
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Key Policies & Guidelines" icon="scale-balanced">
    Important rules, compliance requirements, or best practices that apply to all activities in this category.

    **Example:** "All screening decisions must be documented. Avoid questions about age, marital status, or other protected categories (see Compliance Guide)."
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Resources & Tools" icon="toolbox">
    What do team members need to know before starting these activities?

    **Example:** "Screening uses our ATS (Applicant Tracking System). Training video available here. Screening rubric template here."
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### When to Use Blueprints

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Complex Categories" icon="diagram-project">
    When a category involves multiple steps that need context to understand
  </Card>
  <Card title="New Team Members" icon="user-plus">
    When onboarding people who need to understand the "why" behind activities
  </Card>
  <Card title="Compliance Requirements" icon="shield-check">
    When there are important rules or regulations that apply to the whole category
  </Card>
  <Card title="Strategic Alignment" icon="chess">
    When you need to explain how this category supports business goals
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Blueprint Example

**Category:** Customer Support - Ticket Resolution

**Blueprint Content:**

> **Purpose**
> This phase covers how we resolve customer support tickets from initial receipt through final resolution. Our goal is to resolve 90% of tickets within 24 hours while maintaining a 4.5+ satisfaction rating.
>
> **Our Approach**
> We use a triage system to prioritize urgent issues while ensuring no ticket falls through the cracks. All agents use the same decision tree to maintain consistency.
>
> **Key Policies**
> - Acknowledge all tickets within 2 hours
> - Escalate to Level 2 support after 3 contact attempts
> - Never close a ticket without customer confirmation
> - Document all solutions in the knowledge base
>
> **Tools & Resources**
> - Zendesk (ticketing system) - [Training link]
> - Decision tree flowchart - [View here]
> - Escalation matrix - [View here]
> - Knowledge base - [View here]

## Guides Explained

Guides are attached to individual activities and provide detailed, step-by-step instructions for completing that specific task.

### What Guides Contain

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Step-by-Step Instructions" icon="list-ol" defaultOpen>
    Clear, sequential steps to complete the activity.

    **Example for "Screen Resume":**
    1. Open the ATS and navigate to the job posting
    2. Review resume against minimum qualifications checklist
    3. Score candidate using the rubric (0-5 scale)
    4. If score is 4+, click "Advance to Phone Screen"
    5. If score is 3 or below, click "Reject" and select reason
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Decision Points" icon="code-branch">
    What to do when faced with choices or exceptions.

    **Example:** "If the candidate lacks one required skill but excels in all others, flag for hiring manager review before rejecting."
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Screenshots & Visuals" icon="image">
    Show exactly what buttons to click, forms to fill out, or what the result should look like.

    Visual guides are faster to follow than text descriptions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Tips & Common Mistakes" icon="lightbulb">
    Helpful advice to avoid errors or work more efficiently.

    **Example:** "Tip: Focus on quantifiable achievements rather than job duties. Mistake to avoid: Don't reject candidates for typos in creative roles."
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### When to Use Guides

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Routine Tasks" icon="rotate">
    Activities performed regularly that benefit from standardized steps
  </Card>
  <Card title="Complex Procedures" icon="gears">
    Multi-step activities where mistakes are costly
  </Card>
  <Card title="Software/System Use" icon="computer">
    Activities that involve navigating specific tools or platforms
  </Card>
  <Card title="Training" icon="chalkboard-user">
    When new team members need to learn how to perform tasks
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Can You Use Both?

**Yes!** Blueprints and guides serve different purposes and work well together.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Use Both When">
    ✅ The category is complex enough to need context
    ✅ Individual activities require detailed instructions
    ✅ You have both experienced and new team members
    ✅ The process has compliance or quality requirements

    **Example:** Employee onboarding might have:
    - Blueprint for "First Week Training" category explaining training philosophy and goals
    - Guides for specific activities like "Set up email account" and "Complete tax forms"
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Use Just Blueprints When">
    ✅ Activities are simple and self-explanatory
    ✅ You need to explain the category's purpose but steps are straightforward
    ✅ The value is in understanding context, not step-by-step details

    **Example:** "Executive Approval" category might just need a blueprint explaining approval criteria, while the actual activities ("Submit to CEO", "Await decision") don't need guides.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Use Just Guides When">
    ✅ The category is obvious and needs no explanation
    ✅ Specific activities have complex procedures that need documentation
    ✅ Your focus is on execution, not understanding

    **Example:** "Data Entry" activities might just need guides showing how to use the system correctly, while the category needs no blueprint.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Use Neither When">
    ✅ The process is simple and obvious to everyone
    ✅ Activities are self-explanatory
    ✅ Your team already knows how to do everything

    **Example:** A simple approval process with activities like "Review document" and "Click approve button" might not need either.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Blueprints vs Guides in Practice

Let's see how both might work together for a real process:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Example: Sales Process - Discovery Phase" icon="handshake" defaultOpen>
    **Category:** Discovery & Needs Analysis

    **Blueprint for Category:**
    - Purpose of discovery phase
    - Questions we aim to answer
    - BANT framework explanation
    - Common red flags to watch for
    - Qualification criteria
    - When to advance vs. disqualify

    **Guide for Activity "Conduct Discovery Call":**
    1. Schedule 30-minute Zoom call
    2. Use discovery call script template
    3. Complete BANT questionnaire during call
    4. Take notes in CRM (required fields: budget range, timeline, decision makers)
    5. Score lead 1-5 using rubric
    6. Send follow-up email within 4 hours
    7. Update deal stage in CRM

    **Guide for Activity "Analyze Qualification Criteria":**
    1. Review discovery notes
    2. Complete qualification scorecard
    3. Check if all BANT criteria are met
    4. If qualified: advance to proposal stage
    5. If not qualified but promising: schedule follow-up in 3 months
    6. If not qualified: send "not a fit" email using template

    The **blueprint** gives the big picture and philosophy. The **guides** give specific steps for each activity.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Example: HR - Onboarding" icon="user-plus">
    **Category:** First Day Activities

    **Blueprint for Category:**
    - Goals for the first day
    - Creating a welcoming experience
    - Legal requirements to complete
    - Common first-day challenges
    - Success metrics (new hire satisfaction)

    **Guide for Activity "Conduct Welcome Session":**
    1. Meet new hire in reception at 9:00 AM
    2. Give office tour (use checklist)
    3. Introduce to immediate team
    4. Review agenda for first week
    5. Answer questions
    6. Complete welcome session form

    **Guide for Activity "Set Up Workstation":**
    1. Verify equipment arrived (laptop, monitor, keyboard, mouse)
    2. Log into laptop using IT-provided credentials
    3. Set up email account (use setup guide)
    4. Install required software (see IT onboarding checklist)
    5. Test access to key systems
    6. Document any issues in IT ticket system

    The **blueprint** explains the importance of first impressions. The **guides** ensure nothing gets forgotten.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Choosing the Right Documentation

Ask yourself these questions:

| Question | Yes = Blueprint | Yes = Guide |
|----------|----------------|-------------|
| Does the category need context or explanation? | ✅ | |
| Are there policies that apply to all activities? | ✅ | |
| Do activities require detailed procedures? | | ✅ |
| Are team members new to this process? | ✅ | ✅ |
| Is this a compliance-heavy process? | ✅ | ✅ |
| Are the activities simple and obvious? | | ❌ Not needed |
| Is the category self-explanatory? | ❌ Not needed | |

## Documentation Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Start Simple" icon="seedling">
    Create basic documentation first. Add detail as you discover gaps.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Avoid Duplication" icon="copy">
    Don't repeat information in both blueprints and guides. Link between them instead.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Keep It Updated" icon="rotate">
    Review documentation when processes change. Outdated docs are worse than no docs.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Get Feedback" icon="comments">
    Ask team members if documentation is helpful. Improve based on their input.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Warning>
**Common mistake:** Creating duplicate documentation in blueprints, guides, and SOPs. Choose the right level of documentation and link between them rather than copying content.
</Warning>

## Documentation Hierarchy

Here's how all documentation types relate:

<Steps>
  <Step title="SOP (Process-Level)">
    Standard Operating Procedure covers the entire core process
    - Purpose and scope
    - High-level flow
    - Roles and responsibilities
    - Links to blueprints and guides
  </Step>
  <Step title="Blueprint (Category-Level)">
    Provides context for a category of activities
    - Why this category exists
    - Key policies and guidelines
    - Tools and resources
    - Links to guides for specific activities
  </Step>
  <Step title="Guide (Activity-Level)">
    Step-by-step instructions for one activity
    - How to complete this specific task
    - Screenshots and examples
    - Tips and common mistakes
    - Links to related forms or templates
  </Step>
</Steps>
