## Two Types of Documentation

MPQA offers two ways to document different levels of your process:

- **Blueprints** - Category-level documentation that provides context and overview for a group of related activities
- **Guides** - Activity-level documentation that provides step-by-step instructions for individual tasks

Both serve different purposes and use the same rich text editor for creating documentation with version history.

<Info>
Think of blueprints as the "why" and guides as the "how." Blueprints explain the big picture for a category; guides explain specific steps for an activity.
</Info>

## Quick Comparison

| Feature | Blueprints | Guides |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| **Scope** | Entire category | Single activity |
| **Purpose** | Context and overview | Step-by-step instructions |
| **Attached to** | Activity categories | Individual activities |
| **Access from** | "Blueprint" button on category bar in Process Flow | Click activity name or access from activity view |
| **Editor** | Rich text editor with version history | Rich text editor with version history |
| **Special features** | Metadata sidebar with Blueprint Details | Forms sidebar - can attach forms to guides |
| **Best for** | Training, onboarding, category context | Execution, task completion, detailed procedures |
| **Audience** | Everyone involved in the category | Person performing the specific activity |

## Blueprints Explained

Blueprints are attached to activity categories and provide high-level documentation for a group of related activities.

### Accessing Blueprints

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Process Flow">
    Go to your core process and click the **Visual** tab to see the Process Flow diagram.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Find the Category">
    Each category appears as a colored horizontal bar (e.g., red, green, blue) with the category name on the left.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click Blueprint">
    On the right side of the category bar, click the **"Blueprint"** button.

    This opens the Blueprint editor for that category.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Blueprint Editor Interface

When you open a blueprint, you'll see:

**Top navigation:**
- Title showing category name (e.g., "E - Blueprint")
- Breadcrumb: Process > Sub-process > Category name
- Action buttons: Back to RACI, Workflow, KPIs, Delete Blueprint, Create SOP

**Main area:**
- Rich text editor with full formatting toolbar
- Menu bar: File, Edit, View, Insert, Format, Tools, Table, Help
- Placeholder text: "Start typing..."

**Left sidebar:**
- **Version History** showing all saved versions

**Right sidebar:**
- **Metadata** section with:
  - Version Info (version number, created date, created by)
  - Blueprint Details (type: Blueprint, parent category)

### What Blueprints Contain

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Category Overview" icon="book-open" defaultOpen>
    Explain what this category of activities accomplishes and why it exists.

    **Example:** A blueprint for "Discovery Phase" might explain your company's approach to understanding customer needs, the questions you aim to answer, and how discovery impacts the overall sales process.

    This gives everyone context before diving into specific activities.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Category Objectives" icon="bullseye">
    What are you trying to accomplish with this group of activities?

    **Example:** "The goal of the screening phase is to identify the top 10% of applicants who meet our technical requirements and culture fit, reducing interview time while maintaining quality of hires."

    Clear objectives help team members understand success criteria.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Key Policies & Guidelines" icon="scale-balanced">
    Important rules, compliance requirements, or best practices that apply to all activities in this category.

    **Example:** "All screening decisions must be documented in the ATS. Avoid questions about protected categories. Use the standardized rubric for all candidates to ensure fair evaluation."

    This ensures consistent application of policies across all category activities.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Tools & Resources" icon="toolbox">
    What systems, templates, or resources do team members need for this category?

    **Example:** "This phase uses our Contract Management System (link). Required templates: Legal Review Checklist (link), Pricing Comparison Spreadsheet (link). Training video available here (link)."

    Providing resources upfront prevents interruptions during execution.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Process Flow Context" icon="diagram-project">
    How does this category fit into the larger process? What comes before and after?

    **Example:** "Discovery happens after initial qualification but before proposal development. Information gathered here directly informs our pricing and solution design."

    Context helps people understand their role in the bigger picture.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Guides Explained

Guides are attached to individual activities and provide detailed, step-by-step instructions for completing that specific task.

### Accessing Guides

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Your Activity">
    Go to your core process and find the specific activity you want to document.

    You can access activities from the RACI matrix or Process Flow diagram.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Open the Activity">
    Click on the activity name to open its detailed view.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Access the Guide">
    Look for the Guide section or click a "Create Guide" option.

    This opens the Guide editor for that activity.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Guide Editor Interface

When you open a guide, you'll see:

**Top navigation:**
- Title showing activity name (e.g., "e - Guide")
- Breadcrumb: Process > Sub-process > Activity name
- Action buttons: Back to RACI, KPIs, Create SOP

**Main area:**
- Rich text editor with full formatting toolbar (identical to Blueprints)
- Menu bar: File, Edit, View, Insert, Format, Tools, Table, Help
- Placeholder text: "Start typing..."

**Left sidebar:**
- **Version History** showing all saved versions

**Right sidebar:**
- **Forms** section with:
  - "+ Add New Form" button
  - Note: "Guide SOP Required - Create a guide SOP first before adding forms"

<Info>
Guides have a unique Forms feature that Blueprints don't have. You can attach forms to guides to collect structured data during activity execution.
</Info>

### What Guides Contain

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Step-by-Step Instructions" icon="list-ol" defaultOpen>
    Clear, sequential steps to complete the activity from start to finish.

    **Format:**
    1. [Action verb] [what to do] - Brief explanation
    2. [Action verb] [what to do] - Include system names or field names
    3. [Action verb] [what to do] - Add important considerations

    **Example for "Screen Resume":**
    1. Open the ATS and navigate to the job posting
    2. Review resume against minimum qualifications checklist
    3. Score candidate using the rubric (0-5 scale)
    4. If score is 4+, click "Advance to Phone Screen"
    5. If score is 3 or below, click "Reject" and select reason from dropdown

    Numbered steps make it clear what order to follow.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Decision Points & Variations" icon="code-branch">
    What to do when faced with choices, exceptions, or different scenarios.

    **Format:**
    - **If [condition], then [action]**
    - **If [different condition], then [different action]**

    **Example:**
    - **If candidate lacks one required skill but excels in all others:** Flag for hiring manager review before rejecting
    - **If resume shows job-hopping (5+ jobs in 5 years):** Note in review comments for interview discussion
    - **If candidate requests remote work:** Verify position allows remote before advancing

    Decision points prevent confusion when standard procedure doesn't cover all situations.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Screenshots & Visuals" icon="image">
    Show exactly what buttons to click, forms to fill out, or what the result should look like.

    **Use screenshots for:**
    - System interfaces showing specific fields or buttons
    - Correctly filled forms as examples
    - Expected results after completing the activity

    Visual guides are faster to follow than text descriptions and reduce errors.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Tips & Best Practices" icon="lightbulb">
    Helpful advice to work more efficiently or avoid common mistakes.

    **Examples:**
    - **Tip:** Focus on quantifiable achievements rather than job duties when reviewing resumes
    - **Tip:** Schedule contract reviews for morning hours when Legal team is most responsive
    - **Common mistake:** Don't reject candidates for minor typos in creative roles
    - **Best practice:** Keep frequently-used templates bookmarked for quick access

    These insights come from experienced team members who've found better ways to work.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Tools & Templates" icon="toolbox">
    Specific tools, templates, or resources needed for this individual activity.

    **Examples:**
    - Resume screening rubric template (link)
    - ATS system login (link to system)
    - Rejection email templates (link to templates)
    - Qualification checklist (link to checklist)

    Direct links save time and ensure people use the right resources.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Guide Forms Feature

Guides have a unique capability that Blueprints don't have: **Forms**.

**What are Forms?**

Forms allow you to attach structured data collection to an activity guide. This could be:
- Checklists that must be completed during the activity
- Data entry forms for capturing specific information
- Quality control forms for verifying work
- Approval forms for sign-offs

**Requirement:**

Before you can add forms to a guide, you must first create a guide SOP. This ensures the procedural documentation exists before adding structured data collection.

<Note>
The Forms sidebar shows: "Guide SOP Required - Create a guide SOP first before adding forms."
</Note>

### When to Use Guides

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Routine Tasks" icon="rotate">
    Activities performed regularly that benefit from standardized, documented steps to ensure consistency.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Complex Procedures" icon="gears">
    Multi-step activities where mistakes are costly and detailed instructions prevent errors.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Software/System Use" icon="computer">
    Activities that involve navigating specific tools, platforms, or interfaces where screenshots are valuable.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Training New Team Members" icon="chalkboard-user">
    When new employees need clear instructions to learn how to perform tasks independently.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Blueprints vs Guides: Key Differences

Understanding when to use each type of documentation:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Scope">
    **Blueprints: Category-Level**
    
    Cover a group of related activities that form a phase or stage of your process.
    
    Example: "Candidate Screening" category might include activities like "Review Resume," "Phone Screen," "Check References"
    
    The blueprint provides context for all these activities together.

    **Guides: Activity-Level**
    
    Cover one specific task within your process.
    
    Example: "Review Resume" is a single activity
    
    The guide provides step-by-step instructions for just that one task.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Purpose">
    **Blueprints: Why & Context**
    
    Answer questions like:
    - Why does this category exist?
    - What are we trying to achieve?
    - What policies apply to these activities?
    - How does this fit into the larger process?

    **Guides: How & Execution**
    
    Answer questions like:
    - What are the exact steps?
    - Where do I click?
    - What do I do if X happens?
    - What tools do I need?
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Audience">
    **Blueprints: Team-Level**
    
    Read by:
    - Everyone involved in the category
    - New team members learning the process
    - Managers understanding team workflows
    - Stakeholders understanding process design

    **Guides: Performer-Level**
    
    Read by:
    - The person actually performing the activity
    - Someone learning to do the specific task
    - Quality reviewers checking if steps were followed
    - Trainers teaching the procedure
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Content Style">
    **Blueprints: Narrative & Explanatory**
    
    Written in paragraphs explaining concepts, providing background, and establishing context.
    
    Uses prose to help readers understand the thinking behind decisions.

    **Guides: Procedural & Instructional**
    
    Written in numbered steps with clear actions.
    
    Uses imperative voice: "Click this," "Enter that," "Review these"
    
    Focuses on execution, not explanation.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Can You Use Both?

**Yes!** Blueprints and guides serve different purposes and work very well together.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Use Both When">
    The category is complex enough to need context AND individual activities require detailed instructions.

    **Example: Employee Onboarding**
    
    **Blueprint for "First Week Training" category:**
    - Goals for the first week
    - Creating a welcoming experience
    - Legal requirements to complete
    - Company culture and values
    - Training philosophy

    **Guides for individual activities:**
    - "Set up email account" - Step-by-step system instructions
    - "Complete tax forms" - Form-by-form guidance
    - "Meet with manager" - Agenda and talking points
    - "System access requests" - Exactly what to request and where

    The blueprint gives new hires context about why their first week matters. The guides ensure they complete each task correctly.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Use Just Blueprints When">
    The category needs explanation but individual activities are simple and self-explanatory.

    **Example: Executive Approval Category**
    
    **Blueprint needed:**
    - What requires executive approval and why
    - Approval criteria and thresholds
    - Escalation process
    - Expected response times
    - How to prepare materials for executives

    **Guides not needed:**
    - "Submit to CEO" - Just attach document and send email (obvious)
    - "Await decision" - No procedural steps to document
    - "Communicate decision" - Standard communication, no special procedure

    The value is in understanding the approval criteria, not in documenting simple actions.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Use Just Guides When">
    The category purpose is obvious but specific activities have complex procedures.

    **Example: Data Entry Category**
    
    **Blueprint not needed:**
    - Everyone knows data entry means entering data
    - Purpose is self-evident
    - No special policies beyond standard data handling

    **Guides needed:**
    - "Enter customer information" - Specific fields, validation rules, where to find data
    - "Import batch records" - System steps, file format requirements, error handling
    - "Verify data accuracy" - Checking procedures, acceptable error rates

    Focus on making sure people do the tasks correctly, not explaining why data entry exists.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Use Neither When">
    The process is simple and obvious to everyone on the team.

    **Example: Simple approval with minimal steps**
    
    Activities like "Review document" and "Click approve button" may not need documentation if:
    - The team is experienced
    - The system is intuitive
    - There are no special policies
    - Mistakes have low impact

    Don't create documentation just for the sake of documentation. Create it when it adds value.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Documentation Strategy

Here's how to think about documentation for your processes:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start with RACI">
    Define your activities and assign RACI roles first. This clarifies what work happens and who does it.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Identify Complex Categories">
    Look for categories that:
    - Have multiple related activities
    - Require understanding of policies or compliance
    - Need context for new team members
    - Support strategic business goals

    These benefit from Blueprints.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Identify Complex Activities">
    Look for activities that:
    - Have multiple steps
    - Use specific systems or tools
    - Have decision points or variations
    - Are performed by different people at different times

    These benefit from Guides.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create Documentation Incrementally">
    Don't try to document everything at once. Start with:
    1. Most important categories (Blueprints)
    2. Most complex activities (Guides)
    3. Most error-prone activities (Guides)
    4. Fill in remaining documentation over time
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Link Between Blueprints and Guides" icon="link">
    Reference guides in your blueprints and vice versa. Create a connected documentation system.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Avoid Duplication" icon="copy">
    Don't repeat information in both blueprints and guides. Keep category-level info in blueprints, activity details in guides.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Keep It Updated" icon="rotate">
    Review documentation when processes change. Set quarterly review reminders.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Get Feedback" icon="comments">
    Ask team members if documentation is helpful. Update based on their questions and confusion.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Warning>
Common mistake: Creating duplicate documentation at multiple levels. Choose the right level (category vs activity) and keep information there, then link between documents rather than copying content.
</Warning>

## Documentation Hierarchy

Here's how all documentation types relate in MPQA:

**Process Level: SOP**
- Standard Operating Procedure covers the entire core process
- High-level purpose, scope, and flow
- Links to category blueprints

**Category Level: Blueprint**
- Provides context for a group of related activities
- Why this category exists and what it accomplishes
- Policies that apply to all activities in the category
- Links to activity guides

**Activity Level: Guide**
- Step-by-step instructions for one specific activity
- How to complete this task correctly
- Tools, templates, and resources for this activity
- Can have forms attached for data collection
