## KPIs Explained Simply

KPI stands for **Key Performance Indicator**. In plain English, KPIs are the numbers that tell you if your processes are working well.

Think of KPIs like the dashboard in your car. Your speedometer, fuel gauge, and engine temperature give you the key numbers you need to know if everything is running smoothly. Business KPIs do the same thing for your processes.

<Info>
KPIs answer the question: "How do we know if this process is successful?" They turn gut feelings into measurable facts.

## KPI Hierarchy in Stage3

Stage3 allows you to track KPIs at different levels of your process:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Level 1: Master Process KPIs">
    **Highest level** - Strategic measures for an entire Master Process.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Level 2: Core Process KPIs">
    **Your level** - Measures for your specific Core Process. This is where you'll likely do most of your tracking.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Level 3: Category KPIs">
    **Phase level** - Measures for a specific phase (Category) within your Core Process.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Level 4: Activity KPIs">
    **Detailed level** - Measures for a single activity.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
You'll typically work with **Core Process KPIs (Level 2)**, **Category KPIs (Level 3)** and **Activity KPIs (Level 4)**. These are the metrics you can directly influence and improve.
</Note>

## Good KPIs vs. Bad KPIs

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Good KPIs">
    **Specific:** "First response time under 2 hours" not "fast response"

    **Measurable:** You can count or calculate it objectively

    **Actionable:** You can do something to improve it

    **Relevant:** Directly related to process success

    **Tied to Goals:** Supports business objectives

    **Example:** "Increase customer satisfaction score from 4.2 to 4.5 within 6 months"
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Bad KPIs">
    **Vague:** "Good customer service" (how do you measure good?)

    **Unmeasurable:** "Make customers happy" (how do you quantify happy?)

    **Not Actionable:** "Industry average revenue" (you can't directly control this)

    **Irrelevant:** Measuring things that don't matter to process success

    **No Target:** "Monitor response time" (okay, but what's the goal?)

    **Example:** "Be better at sales" (what does better mean? how much? by when?)
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## How KPIs Show Status

When you record an "Actual Value" for a KPI, the system automatically calculates its status to show performance at a glance. This "Status Preview" compares your value to the "Target Goal" (and whether "Higher is Better" or "Lower is Better") to give you a color-coded status.

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Green" icon="circle-check" color="#10b981">
    **Meeting or exceeding target**

    Everything is on track
  </Card>
  <Card title="Yellow" icon="triangle-exclamation" color="#f59e0b">
    **Approaching threshold**

    Warning that attention is needed
  </Card>
  <Card title="Red" icon="circle-xmark" color="#ef4444">
    **Below acceptable level**

    Immediate action required
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

**Example:** A KPI has a Goal of 10 and "Higher is Better".
- If you record **11**, your status will likely be **Green**.
- If you record **1** (10% of goal), your status will be **Red**.

## Leading vs. Lagging Indicators

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Lagging Indicators">
    **Measures results after they happen**

    **Characteristics:**
    - Show what already happened
    - Easier to measure
    - Can't be changed retroactively
    - Good for reporting and accountability

    **Examples:**
    - Monthly revenue (result of sales activities)
    - Customer churn rate (result of service quality)
    - Defect rate (result of production quality)

    **Think of it as:** Looking in the rear-view mirror
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Leading Indicators">
    **Predicts future results**

    **Characteristics:**
    - Show what's likely to happen
    - Harder to measure
    - Can be influenced now
    - Good for proactive management

    **Examples:**
    - Number of sales calls (predicts future revenue)
    - Customer satisfaction scores (predicts future churn)
    - Process compliance rate (predicts future defects)

    **Think of it as:** Looking through the windshield
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Tip>
**Best practice:** Use both types. Leading indicators help you steer; lagging indicators tell you if you arrived at your destination.
</Tip>

## How Many KPIs Should You Have?

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Too Few (0-1 KPIs)" icon="down" defaultOpen>
    **Problem:** You can't tell if the process is working

    **Risk:** Flying blind, no way to measure success

    **Solution:** Add at least 2-3 key metrics
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Just Right (2-5 KPIs)" icon="check">
    **Sweet spot for most processes**

    **Benefits:**
    - Enough data to understand performance
    - Not overwhelming to track
    - Focused on what really matters

    **Example:** For customer support:
    1. First response time
    2. Resolution time
    3. Customer satisfaction score
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Too Many (10+ KPIs)" icon="up">
    **Problem:** Tracking becomes burdensome, focus is lost

    **Risk:** Analysis paralysis, not knowing what's actually important

    **Solution:** Narrow down to the vital few metrics that truly indicate success
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Warning>
**Focus on quality over quantity.** It's better to track 3 important KPIs well than to track 20 KPIs poorly.
</Warning>

## KPIs and Continuous Improvement

<Steps>
  <Step title="Establish Baseline">
    Measure current performance. This is your starting point.

    **Example:** Current first response time is 4 hours
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Target">
    Decide where you want to be.

    **Example:** Target is 2 hours
  </Step>

  <Step title="Make Changes">
    Implement improvements to the process.

    **Example:** Add more support staff, use templates, improve tools
  </Step>

  <Step title="Monitor Results">
    Track if KPIs improve.

    **Example:** After changes, first response time drops to 2.5 hours
  </Step>

  <Step title="Adjust and Repeat">
    Keep refining until you hit your target, then set new goals.

    **Example:** Hit 2-hour target, now aim for 1.5 hours
  </Step>
</Steps>
