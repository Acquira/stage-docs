## Why Assign RACI Roles?

RACI assignments clarify who does what for every activity in your process. Without RACI, team members waste time figuring out who should handle tasks, who needs to approve, and who needs updates.

With RACI assignments, everyone knows their role instantly.

<Info>
**Quick reminder:** RACI stands for Responsible (does the work), Accountable (owns the outcome), Consulted (provides input), and Informed (receives updates).

## Before You Assign RACI

Make sure you have:

- **Activities created** in your core process
- **Team members** added to your organization
- **Understanding** of who does what in your process

<Tip>
Map out RACI assignments on paper first. Discuss with your team to avoid conflicts or missed assignments.
</Tip>

## Assigning RACI to an Activity

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Activity">
    Navigate to your core process and find the activity you want to assign roles to.

    Click on the activity to open its detail view, or click the edit icon.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Find the RACI Section">
    Look for a section labeled "RACI", "Roles", "Assignments", or similar.

    You'll see four categories: Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Assign Accountable First">
    Start by assigning the **Accountable** person - the one who owns the outcome.

    **Important:** You must assign exactly ONE Accountable person. No more, no less.

    Click "Add" or the "+" next to Accountable and select a team member from the dropdown.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Assign Responsible">
    Next, assign who does the actual work (Responsible).

    You can assign multiple people if several team members share the work.

    Click "Add" next to Responsible and select team member(s).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Assign Consulted (If Needed)">
    Add anyone who needs to provide input or expertise before the work is done.

    Only include people whose expertise is truly necessary. Too many Consulted people slow things down.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Assign Informed (If Needed)">
    Add anyone who needs to receive updates after the work is done.

    Keep this list focused. Only include stakeholders who truly need to know.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save Assignments">
    Click "Save" to apply your RACI assignments.

    The assignments now appear in the activity view, diagrams, and RACI matrices.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Mapping Team Members to Roles

You can assign RACI roles in two ways:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="By Individual">
    **Assign specific people by name**

    **Example:**
    - Responsible: Sarah Johnson
    - Accountable: Mike Chen
    - Consulted: Legal Team (3 people)
    - Informed: All Managers (5 people)

    **Best for:** Small teams, specific one-time processes, clear individual accountability
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="By Role/Position">
    **Assign by job title or role**

    **Example:**
    - Responsible: Recruiter
    - Accountable: Hiring Manager
    - Consulted: Department Head
    - Informed: HR Director

    **Best for:** Scalable processes, processes that work regardless of who fills the role, documentation that survives turnover
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Note>
Many organizations use a hybrid approach: assign by role in the process documentation, then map actual people to those roles for specific process instances.
</Note>

## RACI Assignment Examples

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Example 1: Approve Marketing Budget" icon="money-bill" defaultOpen>
    **Activity:** Approve Marketing Budget Request

    - **Responsible:** Marketing Director (prepares the request and justification)
    - **Accountable:** CFO (makes the final approval decision)
    - **Consulted:** CEO (provides strategic input), Finance Manager (ensures budget alignment)
    - **Informed:** Marketing Team (learns about the approved budget), Finance Team (updates financial systems)

    **Why this works:** One person owns the decision (CFO), one does the work (Marketing Director), experts provide input, and stakeholders stay informed.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Example 2: Conduct Phone Interview" icon="phone">
    **Activity:** Conduct Phone Interview with Candidate

    - **Responsible:** Recruiter (conducts the actual interview)
    - **Accountable:** Hiring Manager (decides if candidate moves forward)
    - **Consulted:** Department Lead (if needed for technical questions)
    - **Informed:** HR Coordinator (updates candidate status in system)

    **Why this works:** Clear ownership with the hiring manager, recruiter does the work, and HR stays in the loop.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Example 3: Launch Product Feature" icon="rocket">
    **Activity:** Deploy New Feature to Production

    - **Responsible:** Engineering Team (3 developers - perform the deployment)
    - **Accountable:** Engineering Manager (owns the deployment decision and rollback if needed)
    - **Consulted:** Product Manager (confirms feature is ready), QA Lead (confirms testing complete)
    - **Informed:** Customer Support (prepares for user questions), Sales Team (updates pitch decks)

    **Why this works:** Multiple people can be Responsible when they share the work, but one person is Accountable for the outcome.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Example 4: Monthly Financial Close" icon="calendar-check">
    **Activity:** Reconcile Bank Accounts

    - **Responsible:** Accounting Specialist (performs reconciliation)
    - **Accountable:** Controller (reviews and approves reconciliation)
    - **Consulted:** - (no consultation needed for routine task)
    - **Informed:** CFO (receives summary report)

    **Why this works:** Routine tasks often don't need Consulted roles. Keep it simple.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Multiple Assignments

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Multiple Responsible" icon="users" color="#3b82f6">
    **Allowed:** Yes

    Multiple people can share the work. Be clear about who does what part.

    **Example:** Three recruiters all screen candidates
  </Card>
  <Card title="Multiple Accountable" icon="shield-xmark" color="#ef4444">
    **Allowed:** NO

    Only ONE person can be accountable. Multiple owners = no owner.

    **Fix:** Choose the person with final decision authority
  </Card>
  <Card title="Multiple Consulted" icon="comments" color="#10b981">
    **Allowed:** Yes

    Several experts can provide input. But keep it focused to avoid delays.

    **Example:** Legal, Finance, and Sales all consulted on pricing
  </Card>
  <Card title="Multiple Informed" icon="bell" color="#8b5cf6">
    **Allowed:** Yes

    Many stakeholders can receive updates. Just don't overdo it.

    **Example:** All department heads informed of policy changes
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Warning>
**The One Accountable Rule**

This is the most important RACI rule. Every activity must have exactly ONE Accountable person. If you think you need two, ask: "Who has final say if they disagree?" That person is Accountable.
</Warning>

## RACI Assignment Best Practices

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Start Right">
    ✅ Assign Accountable first
    ✅ Choose the person with final decision authority
    ✅ Make sure every activity has ONE Accountable person
    ✅ Assign Responsible to whoever does the actual work
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Keep It Focused">
    ✅ Only consult people whose expertise is truly needed
    ✅ Only inform people who need to take action based on updates
    ✅ When in doubt, leave someone off the list
    ✅ You can always add people later
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Be Specific">
    ✅ Use job titles or roles that will survive employee turnover
    ✅ Document what "Responsible" means if multiple people share it
    ✅ Clarify what input Consulted people should provide
    ✅ Note when Informed people receive updates (after completion, daily, etc.)
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Test It">
    ✅ Walk through the process with your team
    ✅ Ask: "Does everyone know what they're supposed to do?"
    ✅ Identify gaps where no one is assigned
    ✅ Look for activities where everyone is Consulted (too many cooks)
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Common RACI Mistakes

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Mistake: Everyone is Accountable" icon="triangle-exclamation" defaultOpen>
    **Problem:** "We all own this together!"

    **Why it fails:** When everyone is accountable, no one is. Decisions stall because there's no clear owner.

    **Fix:** Choose ONE person who makes the final call. Others can be Responsible or Consulted, but only one is Accountable.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Mistake: Too Many Consulted" icon="users">
    **Problem:** 10+ people are Consulted on a simple decision.

    **Why it fails:** Gathering input from too many people creates delays and decision fatigue.

    **Fix:** Only consult people whose expertise directly impacts the decision. Others can be Informed instead.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Mistake: No Responsible Person" icon="circle-question">
    **Problem:** Activity has an Accountable person but no Responsible person.

    **Why it fails:** Someone owns the outcome, but no one is doing the work!

    **Fix:** Assign who actually performs the activity. Sometimes the Accountable person is also Responsible.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Mistake: Confusing Consulted and Informed" icon="shuffle">
    **Problem:** People who just need updates are marked as Consulted.

    **Why it fails:** Consulted people expect to provide input. If you just need to notify them, they're Informed.

    **Fix:** Use Consulted for two-way input, Informed for one-way notifications.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Mistake: Overly Detailed Assignments" icon="microscope">
    **Problem:** Assigning RACI to every tiny sub-task.

    **Why it fails:** Creates administrative overhead with little value. RACI is for meaningful activities, not every mouse click.

    **Fix:** Assign RACI to activity-level tasks, not sub-steps within activities.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

Need to change who's assigned to an activity?

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Activity">
    Navigate to the activity with assignments you want to change.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Edit RACI Section">
    Click "Edit" in the RACI section or open the activity editor.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add or Remove People">
    - To add: Click "Add" and select team members
    - To remove: Click the "X" or trash icon next to a person's name
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save Changes">
    Click "Save" to update the assignments.
  </Step>
</Steps>

</Info>

## Viewing RACI Assignments

Once assigned, you can view RACI in several ways:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="In Activities" icon="list-check">
    See assignments directly on each activity in your process view
  </Card>
  <Card title="In Swimlane Diagrams" icon="water">
    View assignments visually with each role in its own lane
  </Card>
  <Card title="In RACI Matrix" icon="table">
    See a grid of all activities and assignments at once
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## RACI by Process Type

Different processes have different RACI patterns:

| Process Type | Typical Accountable | Typical Responsible | Typical Consulted |
|--------------|-------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Approval Process** | Manager/Director | Specialist/Analyst | Subject Matter Experts |
| **Creation Process** | Team Lead | Designer/Developer | Stakeholders |
| **Review Process** | Senior Role | Reviewer | Original Creator |
| **Communication** | Sender | Sender (can be same) | Message Approver |
| **Execution Process** | Project Manager | Team Members | Department Heads |

## Tips for Large Teams

If you have many team members, RACI assignment can get complex:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Use Groups" icon="user-group">
    If your system supports it, create groups like "Marketing Team" or "Engineering" instead of listing individuals.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Assign by Role" icon="id-badge">
    Use job titles or roles instead of names so processes survive team changes.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Document Defaults" icon="file-lines">
    Create a guide showing standard RACI patterns for your organization.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Review Regularly" icon="rotate">
    As teams change, review and update RACI assignments quarterly.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## RACI Assignment Checklist

Before considering an activity "complete," verify:

- [ ] Exactly ONE Accountable person assigned
- [ ] At least one Responsible person assigned
- [ ] Consulted limited to essential experts only
- [ ] Informed limited to stakeholders who need updates
- [ ] All assignments make sense when walking through the process
- [ ] Team members confirm they understand their roles

## What Happens After Assignment?

Once RACI roles are assigned:

- **Swimlane diagrams** automatically organize by Responsible person
- **Team members** can see their assignments in their personal dashboards
- **Notifications** can be sent to appropriate people when activities start or complete
- **Reports** can show workload distribution across team members

<Tip>
Some systems let you filter views by RACI role. For example, show "All activities where I'm Accountable" to see your decision points.
