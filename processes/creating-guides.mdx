## What Are Activity Guides?

Activity guides are detailed, step-by-step instructions for completing a specific activity. They're the "how-to" documentation that helps team members perform tasks correctly and consistently.

Think of guides as recipes. They provide clear, sequential steps that anyone can follow to achieve the same result.

<Info>
Guides are attached to individual activities, not categories. For category-level documentation, use blueprints instead.

</Info>

## When to Create Guides

Create guides for activities that:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Are Complex" icon="gears">
    Multi-step tasks where mistakes are costly or common
  </Card>
  <Card title="Use Systems" icon="computer">
    Activities requiring navigation through software or specific tools
  </Card>
  <Card title="Need Consistency" icon="equals">
    Tasks that must be done the same way every time for quality or compliance
  </Card>
  <Card title="Train New Staff" icon="graduation-cap">
    Activities that new team members need to learn
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Warning>
**Don't create guides for obvious tasks.** Activities like "Approve document" or "Reply to email" that are self-explanatory don't need guides. Focus on activities that benefit from detailed instruction.
</Warning>

## Creating Your First Guide

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Your Activity">
    Open the core process and find the activity you want to document.

    Click on the activity to open its detail view.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Find the Guide Section">
    Look for a "Guide," "Instructions," or "How-To" section in the activity details.

    You may see a tab or button labeled "Create Guide."
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click Create Guide">
    Click the **"Create Guide"** or **"Add Instructions"** button.

    This opens the guide editor.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add a Title">
    Your guide title should match the activity name or clearly reference it.

    **Examples:**
    - "How to Screen Resumes"
    - "Sending Client Proposals - Step by Step"
    - "Processing Refund Requests"

    Keep titles clear and descriptive.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Write Step-by-Step Instructions">
    Break down the activity into clear, sequential steps. Each step should be one action.

    Number your steps and start each with an action verb.

    Use the rich text editor to format your steps clearly.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Visual Aids">
    Include screenshots, videos, or diagrams that show what to do.

    Visual aids make guides faster to follow and reduce errors.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Include Tips and Warnings">
    Add helpful tips, common mistakes to avoid, and troubleshooting advice.

    This makes your guide more practical and useful.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review and Save">
    Walk through your guide as if you're doing the activity for the first time. Is anything unclear?

    Click **"Save"** to publish your guide.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Writing Great Step-by-Step Instructions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Rule 1: One Action Per Step" icon="1" defaultOpen>
    Each step should be one discrete action. Don't combine multiple actions.

    **Good:**
    - Step 1: Open the CRM
    - Step 2: Navigate to the Contacts tab
    - Step 3: Click "Add New Contact"

    **Bad:**
    - Step 1: Open the CRM, go to Contacts, and add a new contact

    Breaking steps down makes them easier to follow.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Rule 2: Start with Action Verbs" icon="play">
    Begin each step with a clear action verb that tells people what to do.

    **Good action verbs:**
    - Click, Select, Enter, Type, Choose, Navigate, Open, Close, Save, Review, Confirm, Verify

    **Example:**
    - "Click the 'Submit' button in the bottom-right corner"
    - "Enter the customer's email address in the 'Email' field"
    - "Select 'Priority: High' from the dropdown menu"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Rule 3: Be Specific" icon="bullseye">
    Provide exact details. Don't assume people will figure it out.

    **Vague:**
    - "Update the document"

    **Specific:**
    - "Update the 'Client Name' field in the contract template with the client's legal business name (check spelling in Salesforce)"

    Specificity prevents errors and questions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Rule 4: Include Location Details" icon="location-dot">
    Tell people exactly where to find buttons, fields, or options.

    **Better:**
    - "Click the 'Save' button"

    **Best:**
    - "Click the blue 'Save' button in the bottom-right corner of the screen"

    Location details help people find things faster.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Rule 5: Explain Decision Points" icon="code-branch">
    When there are choices or conditions, clearly explain what to do.

    **Example:**
    > **Step 4: Determine Priority Level**
    > - If the ticket mentions "urgent," "emergency," or "down," select "Priority: Critical"
    > - If the ticket mentions a deadline within 24 hours, select "Priority: High"
    > - All other tickets: select "Priority: Normal"

    Use if/then logic to cover different scenarios.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Adding Visual Elements

Visual aids make guides much more effective:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Screenshots" icon="image">
    Capture screens showing exactly what buttons to click or forms to fill out
  </Card>
  <Card title="Annotations" icon="pen">
    Add arrows, circles, or highlights to draw attention to specific areas
  </Card>
  <Card title="Screen Recordings" icon="video">
    Record your screen while performing the activity for complex procedures
  </Card>
  <Card title="Flowcharts" icon="diagram-project">
    Show decision trees or branching logic visually
  </Card>
  <Card title="Before/After" icon="right-left">
    Show what the result should look like when done correctly
  </Card>
  <Card title="Templates" icon="file">
    Include sample outputs or filled examples
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Screenshot Best Practices

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="What to Capture">
    ✅ Entire screen or window for context
    ✅ The button, field, or area the user needs to interact with
    ✅ Enough surrounding interface to orient the user
    ✅ Confirmation messages or results
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="How to Annotate">
    ✅ Use red circles or arrows to highlight key areas
    ✅ Add numbered labels matching your step numbers
    ✅ Include text callouts for important notes
    ✅ Keep annotations clean and minimal
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="What to Avoid">
    ❌ Capturing sensitive data (customer info, passwords)
    ❌ Screenshots that are too small to read
    ❌ Outdated screenshots from old system versions
    ❌ Too many annotations that clutter the image
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Complete Guide Example

Here's a full example of a well-written activity guide:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Example: Processing a Customer Refund" icon="money-bill-transfer" defaultOpen>
    **Activity:** Process Customer Refund Request

    ---

    ## Overview
    This guide covers how to process approved refund requests through our payment system and notify the customer.

    ## Prerequisites
    - Refund has been approved by customer service manager
    - Approval email is in the refund ticket
    - Original payment method is still valid

    ## Estimated Time
    5-10 minutes

    ## Tools Needed
    - Stripe Dashboard access
    - Zendesk ticket system access
    - Refund notification email template

    ---

    ## Step-by-Step Instructions

    ### Step 1: Verify Refund Approval
    Open the Zendesk ticket and confirm that:
    - Manager has commented "APPROVED" in the ticket
    - Refund amount is clearly stated
    - Customer account is in good standing

    **Don't proceed without approval.**

    ### Step 2: Open Stripe Dashboard
    1. Navigate to dashboard.stripe.com
    2. Log in with your company credentials
    3. Select "Payments" from the left sidebar

    [Screenshot showing Stripe dashboard with sidebar highlighted]

    ### Step 3: Find the Original Payment
    1. In the search bar, enter the customer's email or order number
    2. Click on the matching payment in the results
    3. Verify the payment details match the refund request:
       - Customer name
       - Amount
       - Date
       - Product/service purchased

    ### Step 4: Issue the Refund
    1. Click the "Refund" button in the top-right of the payment details page
    2. Enter the refund amount (full or partial as approved)
    3. In the "Reason" dropdown, select the appropriate reason:
       - "Requested by customer" (most common)
       - "Duplicate charge"
       - "Fraudulent"
    4. In the notes field, enter the Zendesk ticket number (format: #12345)
    5. Click "Refund [amount]" to confirm

    [Screenshot showing refund form with fields highlighted]

    **The refund will be processed immediately. You cannot undo this action.**

    ### Step 5: Copy the Refund ID
    After the refund processes, Stripe displays a confirmation screen with a refund ID (format: re_1234567890).

    Copy this ID. You'll need it for the customer notification.

    ### Step 6: Update the Zendesk Ticket
    1. Return to the Zendesk ticket
    2. Change the ticket status to "Solved"
    3. Add an internal note with:
       - Refund amount
       - Stripe refund ID
       - Date processed
       - Your name

    **Example:**
    > "Refund processed: $49.99
    > Stripe refund ID: re_1234567890
    > Date: June 15, 2024
    > Processed by: Sarah J."

    ### Step 7: Notify the Customer
    1. In Zendesk, click "Apply Macro"
    2. Select "Refund Processed Notification"
    3. The email template auto-fills with:
       - Customer name
       - Refund amount
       - Estimated arrival time (5-10 business days)
    4. Add the Stripe refund ID to the email where indicated
    5. Review the email for accuracy
    6. Click "Send"

    ---

    ## Decision Points

    **What if the original payment method was deleted?**
    - Stripe will attempt to refund to the card automatically
    - If it fails, contact the customer for current payment details
    - Document the situation in the ticket and escalate to your manager

    **What if the customer wants a refund to a different payment method?**
    - This isn't possible through Stripe
    - Escalate to accounting for a manual check or ACH transfer
    - Add "ACCOUNTING" tag to the ticket

    **What if the refund amount exceeds the original charge?**
    - This should never happen. Do not process.
    - Notify your manager immediately. This may indicate fraud.

    ---

    ## Tips & Best Practices

    ✅ Always verify approval before processing. Unauthorized refunds can't be reversed.

    ✅ Double-check the refund amount. Typos can cause issues.

    ✅ Process refunds within 24 hours of approval for better customer satisfaction.

    ✅ Add the Stripe refund ID to Zendesk. Customers often call asking for status, and you'll need this to look it up.

    ---

    ## Common Mistakes to Avoid

    ❌ **Processing without approval:** Always get manager approval first

    ❌ **Wrong amount:** A $49.99 vs. $499.90 mistake is costly and hard to fix

    ❌ **Forgetting to notify customer:** Customer will call asking when they'll get their money

    ❌ **Not documenting in Zendesk:** Other team members need to see what happened

    ---

    ## Troubleshooting

    **Problem:** "Refund button is grayed out"
    - **Solution:** Payment may still be processing or already refunded. Check the payment status. If unclear, contact Stripe support.

    **Problem:** "Error: Charge has been disputed"
    - **Solution:** Don't process the refund. Contact your manager. Disputed charges follow a different process.

    **Problem:** "Customer says they didn't receive refund after 10 days"
    - **Solution:** Look up the Stripe refund ID, check status, contact customer's bank if needed. See "Late Refund Follow-up Guide."

  <Card title="Test Your Guide" icon="vial">
    Have someone unfamiliar with the task follow your guide. Where do they get confused?
  </Card>
  <Card title="Use Simple Language" icon="comment">
    Write at an 8th-grade reading level. Avoid jargon and complex terminology.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Be Consistent" icon="equals">
    Use the same terms throughout. Don't call something a "button" in one step and an "icon" in another.

## Common Guide Mistakes

<Warning>
**Assuming Knowledge**

Don't assume people know where things are or how systems work. Be explicit about every step, even if it seems obvious to you.
</Warning>

<Warning>
**Combining Too Many Actions**

Keep steps atomic. One step = one action. Combining multiple actions into one step causes confusion.
</Warning>

<Warning>
**Vague Instructions**

"Update the file" doesn't tell someone what to update or how. Be specific about fields, values, and locations.
</Warning>

<Warning>
**Outdated Screenshots**

Screenshots from old system versions confuse users. Update screenshots when interfaces change.
</Warning>

## Forms in Guides

Some activities require forms to be completed. You can attach forms directly to your guides.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create or Upload Form">
    Create a fillable form or upload a form template (PDF, Word, etc.)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Attach to Guide">
    Link the form in your guide, or use the system's form attachment feature if available
  </Step>
  <Step title="Reference in Instructions">
    In your step-by-step instructions, tell users when and how to complete the form

    **Example:** "Step 5: Complete the Budget Request Form (attached below) with all required fields"
  </Step>
</Steps>
