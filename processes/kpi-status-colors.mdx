## The Traffic Light System

KPI status colors work like traffic lights: green means go (everything's fine), yellow means caution (watch out), and red means stop (take action). This visual system lets you assess process health at a glance.

<Info>
Color-coding makes it easy to spot problems quickly without reading through numbers and reports. Your eyes naturally go to red, alerting you to what needs attention.

## The Three Colors

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Green" icon="circle-check" color="#10b981">
    **Meeting or exceeding target**

    Performance is where it should be
  </Card>
  <Card title="Yellow" icon="triangle-exclamation" color="#f59e0b">
    **Warning zone**

    Not yet critical, but attention needed
  </Card>
  <Card title="Red" icon="circle-xmark" color="#ef4444">
    **Below acceptable level**

    Immediate action required
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## How Status Is Determined

The system automatically assigns a color based on:

1. **Your recorded value** (the actual measurement)
2. **Your defined thresholds** (the boundaries between green/yellow/red)
3. **Your measurement direction** (whether higher or lower is better)

You set these thresholds when creating the KPI. The system does the rest automatically.

## Status for "Lower Is Better" Metrics

For metrics where smaller numbers are better (like response time or error rate):

<Steps>
  <Step title="Green Status">
    **Value is at or below target**

    You're meeting or exceeding your goal.

    **Example:** First Response Time
    - Target: 2 hours
    - Recorded: 1.5 hours
    - Status: **Green** ‚úÖ

    Keep up the good work!
  </Step>

  <Step title="Yellow Status">
    **Value is above target but below red threshold**

    Performance is slipping but not yet critical.

    **Example:** First Response Time
    - Target: 2 hours
    - Yellow threshold: 2-3 hours
    - Recorded: 2.7 hours
    - Status: **Yellow** ‚ö†Ô∏è

    Pay attention. Trend toward red if nothing changes.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Red Status">
    **Value exceeds red threshold**

    Performance is unacceptable. Action required.

    **Example:** First Response Time
    - Red threshold: Over 3 hours
    - Recorded: 4.2 hours
    - Status: **Red** üî¥

    Investigate immediately and take corrective action.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Status for "Higher Is Better" Metrics

For metrics where larger numbers are better (like satisfaction scores or sales):

<Steps>
  <Step title="Green Status">
    **Value is at or above target**

    You're meeting or exceeding your goal.

    **Example:** Customer Satisfaction Score
    - Target: 4.5 out of 5
    - Recorded: 4.7
    - Status: **Green** ‚úÖ

    Excellent performance!
  </Step>

  <Step title="Yellow Status">
    **Value is below target but above red threshold**

    Performance is declining but recoverable.

    **Example:** Customer Satisfaction Score
    - Target: 4.5
    - Yellow threshold: 4.0-4.4
    - Recorded: 4.2
    - Status: **Yellow** ‚ö†Ô∏è

    Need improvement to reach target.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Red Status">
    **Value falls below red threshold**

    Performance is critically low. Urgent action needed.

    **Example:** Customer Satisfaction Score
    - Red threshold: Below 4.0
    - Recorded: 3.8
    - Status: **Red** üî¥

    Customers are dissatisfied. Address immediately.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Setting Your Thresholds

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Choose Meaningful Boundaries" icon="map-pin" defaultOpen>
    Thresholds should represent real performance levels, not arbitrary numbers.

    **Good approach:**
    - Green: Performance that meets business needs
    - Yellow: Performance that's acceptable short-term but needs attention
    - Red: Performance that causes real problems

    **Poor approach:**
    - Green: Perfect performance (rarely achieved)
    - Yellow: Anything not perfect
    - Red: Catastrophic failure only

    Make yellow a true early warning, not just "slightly below perfect."
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Leave Room for Yellow" icon="ruler">
    Yellow zone should be wide enough to be useful but not so wide it loses meaning.

    **Example: Support Response Time**
    - Target: 2 hours
    - Green: ‚â§2 hours
    - Yellow: 2-4 hours (gives 2-hour buffer)
    - Red: >4 hours

    **Why this works:** You have time to notice the yellow and improve before hitting red.

    **Bad example:**
    - Target: 2 hours
    - Green: ‚â§2 hours
    - Yellow: 2-2.1 hours (only 6 minutes of warning)
    - Red: >2.1 hours

    This yellow is too narrow to be useful.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Base on Impact" icon="exclamation">
    Red threshold should represent performance that actually causes problems.

    **Questions to ask:**
    - At what point do customers complain?
    - When does this affect other processes?
    - Where is the compliance or contractual limit?
    - What level requires management escalation?

    **Example:** If your SLA promises 4-hour response, your red threshold should be at or before 4 hours, not 8 hours.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Consider Industry Standards" icon="building">
    Look at benchmarks for your industry and process type.

    **Research:**
    - What do competitors achieve?
    - What are industry best practices?
    - What do customers expect?
    - What's realistically achievable?

    Don't set thresholds in a vacuum.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Threshold Examples by Metric Type

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Time-Based Metrics">
    **Lower is better**

    **Example: Time to Hire**
    - Target: 30 days
    - Green: ‚â§30 days
    - Yellow: 31-45 days
    - Red: >45 days

    **Example: Average Handle Time**
    - Target: 8 minutes
    - Green: ‚â§8 minutes
    - Yellow: 8-12 minutes
    - Red: >12 minutes

    **Guideline:** Yellow typically 25-50% above target; red 50-100% above target
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Quality Scores">
    **Higher is better**

    **Example: Customer Satisfaction (1-5 scale)**
    - Target: 4.5
    - Green: ‚â•4.5
    - Yellow: 4.0-4.4
    - Red: less than 4.0

    **Example: Process Accuracy (%)**
    - Target: 98%
    - Green: ‚â•98%
    - Yellow: 95-97%
    - Red: less than 95%

    **Guideline:** Thresholds based on meaningful quality drops
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Percentage Metrics">
    **Higher is better (for conversion, retention, etc.)**

    **Example: Sales Conversion Rate**
    - Target: 25%
    - Green: ‚â•25%
    - Yellow: 20-24%
    - Red: less than 20%

    **Example: First Call Resolution**
    - Target: 80%
    - Green: ‚â•80%
    - Yellow: 70-79%
    - Red: less than 70%

    **Guideline:** Yellow typically 5-10 percentage points below target
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Volume Metrics">
    **Can be "higher is better" or "target range"**

    **Example: Sales Pipeline (higher is better)**
    - Target: $2,000,000
    - Green: ‚â•$2M
    - Yellow: $1.5M-$2M
    - Red: less than $1.5M

    **Example: Inventory Level (target range)**
    - Target range: 1,000-1,500 units
    - Green: 1,000-1,500
    - Yellow: 800-999 or 1,501-1,700
    - Red: less than 800 or greater than 1,700

    **Guideline:** Base on operational impact of being too high or too low
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Understanding Team Scorecards

When you have multiple KPIs, you'll see them together in a scorecard or dashboard:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="All Green" icon="circle-check" defaultOpen>
    **All KPIs in green zone**

    **Meaning:** Process is performing well across all dimensions

    **Action:**
    - Maintain current practices
    - Document what's working
    - Consider raising targets for continuous improvement
    - Share best practices with other teams

    **Communication:** "Process is healthy. No issues to report."
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Some Yellow" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    **One or more KPIs in yellow zone**

    **Meaning:** Process is mostly healthy but needs attention in specific areas

    **Action:**
    - Monitor yellows closely
    - Identify why those metrics are slipping
    - Implement corrective actions
    - Prevent yellows from becoming reds

    **Communication:** "Process is stable with some areas needing attention."
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Some Red" icon="exclamation-triangle">
    **One or more KPIs in red zone**

    **Meaning:** Process has serious issues requiring immediate action

    **Action:**
    - Investigate root cause of reds immediately
    - Implement fixes as top priority
    - Communicate to stakeholders
    - Monitor daily until back in green

    **Communication:** "Process has critical issues. Taking corrective action."
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Mostly Red" icon="circle-xmark">
    **Multiple or all KPIs in red zone**

    **Meaning:** Process is failing and may need significant changes

    **Action:**
    - Escalate to management
    - Consider whether process needs redesign
    - Allocate resources to address
    - Daily updates on improvement efforts

    **Communication:** "Process requires immediate intervention and may need redesign."
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Reading Trends with Colors

Don't just look at current color. Look at the trend:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Improving Trend">
    **Colors moving from red ‚Üí yellow ‚Üí green**

    **Great news!** Your process improvements are working.

    **Action:**
    - Document what you changed
    - Sustain the improvements
    - Share lessons learned
    - Consider if practices can apply elsewhere

    **Example timeline:**
    - Month 1: Red (4.5 hrs)
    - Month 2: Yellow (2.8 hrs)
    - Month 3: Green (1.9 hrs)
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Declining Trend">
    **Colors moving from green ‚Üí yellow ‚Üí red**

    **Warning!** Performance is deteriorating.

    **Action:**
    - Investigate what changed
    - Review if something broke in the process
    - Check if resources or support decreased
    - Take action before hitting red if possible

    **Example timeline:**
    - Month 1: Green (1.8 hrs)
    - Month 2: Yellow (2.5 hrs)
    - Month 3: Red (4.1 hrs)
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Stable">
    **Same color for extended period**

    **If stable green:** Good. Process is consistently meeting targets.

    **If stable yellow/red:** Concerning. Process is consistently underperforming.

    **Action:**
    - For stable green: Maintain, or consider stretch goals
    - For stable yellow/red: Process changes needed, current approach isn't working

    **Example:**
    - 6 months straight in yellow
    - Means temporary fixes aren't enough
    - Need fundamental process improvement
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Volatile">
    **Colors jumping between green, yellow, red unpredictably**

    **Concerning.** Indicates inconsistent execution or external factors.

    **Action:**
    - Investigate why performance is inconsistent
    - Look for patterns (day of week, who's working, etc.)
    - Standardize process execution
    - Identify and control variables

    **Example:**
    - Week 1: Green
    - Week 2: Red
    - Week 3: Green
    - Week 4: Yellow
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## What to Do for Each Color

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Green" icon="circle-check" color="#10b981">
    **Actions:**
    - Continue current practices
    - Document what works
    - Share with team
    - Consider stretch goals

    **Frequency:** Review weekly
  </Card>
  <Card title="Yellow" icon="triangle-exclamation" color="#f59e0b">
    **Actions:**
    - Monitor closely
    - Identify causes
    - Plan improvements
    - Prevent decline to red

    **Frequency:** Review daily
  </Card>
  <Card title="Red" icon="circle-xmark" color="#ef4444">
    **Actions:**
    - Investigate immediately
    - Take corrective action
    - Communicate to team
    - Escalate if needed

    **Frequency:** Review multiple times daily
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Adjusting Thresholds

Sometimes you need to change your thresholds:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="When Performance Consistently Exceeds Target" icon="arrow-trend-up" defaultOpen>
    **Situation:** You're always in green, target seems too easy.

    **Action:** Raise the target and adjust thresholds to drive continuous improvement.

    **Example:**
    - **Old:** Target 4 hours, Green ‚â§4 hrs
    - **New:** Target 2 hours, Green ‚â§2 hrs

    This keeps the team challenged and improving.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="When Target Was Unrealistic" icon="bullseye">
    **Situation:** You're always red despite good performance.

    **Action:** Lower the target to something achievable (if justified).

    **Important:** Only do this if the target was genuinely unrealistic, not just because it's hard to meet.

    **Ask first:** Is there an actual barrier preventing better performance, or do we just need to try harder?
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="When Business Requirements Change" icon="building">
    **Situation:** External factors (customer SLAs, regulations, competitive pressure) change expectations.

    **Action:** Adjust thresholds to reflect new requirements.

    **Example:** Customer SLA changes from 4-hour to 2-hour response. Update your thresholds accordingly.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="When You Learn More" icon="graduation-cap">
    **Situation:** After tracking for a while, you realize your thresholds don't reflect real performance levels.

    **Action:** Refine based on what you've learned.

    **Example:** You thought yellow should be 2-3 hours, but you've learned 2-2.5 hours is fine, and only >2.5 hours causes problems. Adjust accordingly.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Warning>
**Don't manipulate thresholds to make performance look better.** Thresholds should reflect real business needs, not be adjusted to game the system. That defeats the purpose of KPIs.
</Warning>

## Communicating with Colors

Colors make communication faster and clearer:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Executive Reports">
    "Customer Support is **green** across all metrics. Sales is **green** except for conversion rate which is **yellow** and improving. Operations has one **red** KPI (fulfillment time) which we're actively addressing."

    Executives get the full picture in seconds.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Team Meetings">
    "Let's review our scorecard. We have 4 greens, 2 yellows, and 1 red. The red is our response time, which spiked yesterday due to the system outage. Let's focus on that."

    Team knows immediately where to focus discussion.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Email Updates">
    Subject: "Weekly KPI Update: 5 Green, 1 Yellow, 0 Red"

    Recipients know status before even opening the email.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Visual Dashboard Example

A typical KPI dashboard might look like:

| KPI | Current Value | Target | Status | Trend |
|-----|---------------|--------|--------|-------|
| First Response Time | 1.8 hrs | 2 hrs | üü¢ Green | ‚¨áÔ∏è Improving |
| Resolution Time | 6.2 hrs | 8 hrs | üü¢ Green | ‚û°Ô∏è Stable |
| Customer Satisfaction | 4.3 | 4.5 | üü° Yellow | ‚¨áÔ∏è Declining |
| Ticket Backlog | 45 | 30 | üî¥ Red | ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Worsening |
| First Contact Resolution | 78% | 80% | üü° Yellow | ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Improving |

At a glance, you know:
- Two metrics are performing well
- Two need attention
- One requires immediate action
- Trends show which way things are heading

## Tips for Success

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Review Regularly" icon="calendar">
    Check status daily for critical KPIs, weekly for others. Colors are only useful if you look at them.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Act on Reds" icon="bolt">
    Red status must trigger action, every time. If you ignore reds, the system loses value.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Don't Ignore Yellows" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    Yellows are warnings. Address them before they become reds.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Celebrate Greens" icon="party-horn">
    Acknowledge when the team achieves green status. Positive reinforcement matters.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>
