## What Are SOPs?

SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures) are detailed documents that explain how to perform your processes. They're your company's instruction manual for getting work done consistently.

Think of an SOP as a comprehensive guide that covers everything someone needs to know about a process, from start to finish.

<Info>
SOPs are different from guides. SOPs provide high-level process documentation, while guides provide step-by-step instructions for specific activities.

## Creating Your First SOP

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Your Process">
    Open the core process where you want to add an SOP.

    Look for a section labeled "SOP", "Documentation", or "Standard Operating Procedure."
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click Create SOP">
    Click the **"Create SOP"** or **"Add Documentation"** button.

    If your process already has an SOP, you'll see an "Edit" option instead.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add a Title">
    Your SOP title should match or reference your core process name.

    **Examples:**
    - "Remote Employee Onboarding SOP"
    - "Enterprise Sales Process - Standard Operating Procedure"
    - "Monthly Financial Close Procedures"

    Keep it clear and professional.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Write Your SOP Content">
    Use the rich text editor to document your process. Include:

    - **Purpose:** Why this process exists
    - **Scope:** What's included and excluded
    - **Roles & Responsibilities:** Who does what (can reference RACI)
    - **Process Overview:** High-level flow
    - **Detailed Steps:** Activity-by-activity instructions
    - **Tools & Resources:** Systems, templates, or documents needed
    - **Key Policies:** Important rules or compliance requirements

    Don't worry about making it perfect on the first try.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Format for Readability">
    Use the rich text editor's formatting tools:
    - Headings for major sections
    - Bullet points for lists
    - Bold for important terms
    - Links to related resources
    - Tables for complex information

    Good formatting makes SOPs much easier to read and follow.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Visual Elements">
    If available, enhance your SOP with:
    - Screenshots
    - Diagrams
    - Flowcharts
    - Videos
    - Process maps

    Visual elements help people understand complex processes faster.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review and Save">
    Read through your SOP as if you're seeing it for the first time. Does it make sense?

    Click **"Save"** to publish your SOP. Team members with access to the process can now view it.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## SOP Structure Template

A well-organized SOP typically follows this structure:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="1. Header Section" icon="heading" defaultOpen>
    **Include:**
    - Document title
    - Process name
    - Version number
    - Last updated date

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="2. Purpose & Scope" icon="bullseye">
    **Purpose:** A brief statement explaining why this process exists and what it accomplishes.

    **Example:** "This SOP defines how we onboard new remote employees to ensure they have everything needed to succeed in their first 90 days."

    **Scope:** Clarify what's included and what's not.

    **Example:** "This SOP covers full-time employees in all departments. Contractors and part-time employees follow a separate process."
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="3. Roles & Responsibilities" icon="users">
    List the key roles involved in this process and their general responsibilities.

    This prevents people from starting the process prematurely.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="6. Detailed Procedures" icon="file-lines">

    A: Follow the International Hiring supplement to this SOP (link).

    This section grows as you encounter issues and questions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="9. Metrics & Success Criteria" icon="chart-line">
    How do you know if the process is working?

    **Examples:**
    - 100% of new hires complete onboarding within 90 days

    - Zero compliance violations during onboarding

    Link to your KPIs if you've created them.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="10. Revision History" icon="clock-rotate-left">
    Track changes to the SOP over time:

    | Version | Date | Author | Changes |

</AccordionGroup>

## Using the Rich Text Editor

The SOP editor provides formatting tools to make your documentation clear and professional:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Headings" icon="heading">
    Use H1, H2, H3 for section hierarchy. Helps readers scan the document.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Lists" icon="list">
    Bullet points and numbered lists make steps easy to follow.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Bold & Italics" icon="bold">
    Emphasize key terms, warnings, or important information.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Links" icon="link">
    Link to other processes, external resources, or documentation.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Tables" icon="table">
    Organize complex information like role assignments or comparisons.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Images" icon="image">
    Add screenshots, diagrams, or photos to clarify instructions.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Formatting Tips

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="For Readability">
    ✅ Use short paragraphs (2-3 sentences max)
    ✅ Add whitespace between sections
    ✅ Use headings to break up content
    ✅ Start each section with a summary sentence
    ✅ Use bullet points instead of long paragraphs
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="For Scannability">
    ✅ Make key information bold
    ✅ Use consistent heading hierarchy
    ✅ Add a table of contents for long SOPs
    ✅ Include section numbers (1.0, 1.1, 1.2)
    ✅ Use callout boxes for warnings or tips
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="For Action">
    ✅ Start steps with action verbs
    ✅ Be specific about who does what
    ✅ Include deadlines or timeframes
    ✅ Link to detailed guides for complex steps
    ✅ Provide examples where helpful
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Writing Style Guidelines

Your SOP should be clear and easy to follow:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Use Simple Language" icon="comment">
    Write at an 8th-grade reading level. Avoid jargon and complex terms.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Be Specific" icon="bullseye">
    "Send welcome email within 24 hours" is better than "Send email soon."
  </Card>
  <Card title="Use Active Voice" icon="forward">
    "The recruiter schedules interviews" not "Interviews are scheduled."
  </Card>
  <Card title="Be Consistent" icon="equals">
    Use the same terms throughout. Don't switch between "customer" and "client."
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Warning>
**Avoid these common mistakes:**
- Using internal jargon that new employees won't know
- Writing paragraphs longer than 4-5 lines
- Forgetting to update contact information or links
- Making instructions too vague to follow
</Warning>

## Version Control Basics

SOPs evolve as your processes improve. Version control helps track changes:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Mark Initial Version">
    When you first publish your SOP, mark it as version 1.0.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Track Changes">
    When you make updates, note what changed and why.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Update Version Number">
    - Minor updates (fixing typos, small clarifications): 1.1, 1.2, etc.
    - Major updates (new steps, significant changes): 2.0, 3.0, etc.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Document in Revision History">
    Add an entry to your revision history table showing the date, author, and summary of changes.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
Some systems automatically track versions for you. Check if your system has built-in version control before manually tracking versions.
</Info>

## When to Update Your SOP

Update your SOP when:

- The process changes (new steps, removed steps, changed sequence)
- You discover better ways to do things
- Tools or systems change
- Compliance requirements change
- Team members consistently ask the same questions (add to FAQ)
- You find errors or unclear instructions

<Tip>
Set a reminder to review your SOPs quarterly, even if no changes are needed. Regular reviews keep documentation fresh.
</Tip>

## Tips for Success

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Start with an Outline" icon="list">
    Don't just start writing. Outline the sections first, then fill them in.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Get Feedback Early" icon="comments">
    Share your draft SOP with team members who use the process. Their input is invaluable.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Test It" icon="vial">
    Have someone unfamiliar with the process follow your SOP. Where do they get stuck?
  </Card>
  <Card title="Link, Don't Duplicate" icon="link">
    If information exists elsewhere, link to it instead of copying it into your SOP.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Common SOP Mistakes

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Too Much Detail" icon="microscope" defaultOpen>
    **Problem:** Documenting every mouse click makes the SOP overwhelming.

    **Fix:** Document what to do, not how to move your mouse. Save detailed "how-to" instructions for activity guides.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Too Little Detail" icon="eye-slash">
    **Problem:** "Contact the vendor" doesn't tell someone who to contact, when, or how.

    **Fix:** Be specific enough that someone new to the role can complete the task.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Out of Date Information" icon="calendar-xmark">
    **Problem:** SOPs that reference old systems, departed employees, or outdated procedures.

    **Fix:** Review and update SOPs regularly. Archive obsolete versions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="No Visual Aids" icon="image-slash">
    **Problem:** Long walls of text with no diagrams, screenshots, or structure.

    **Fix:** Add headings, images, and formatting to break up text and clarify complex parts.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
