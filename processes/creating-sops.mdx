## What Are SOPs?

SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures) are detailed documents that explain how to perform specific activities in your processes. In MPQA, each activity can have its own SOP that provides step-by-step instructions for completing that task consistently.

Think of an SOP as an instruction manual that covers everything someone needs to know to complete an activity correctly and efficiently.

<Info>
In MPQA, SOPs are activity-level documentation. Each activity in your RACI matrix can have its own dedicated SOP with version history tracking.

## Accessing the SOP Editor

There are two ways to create or edit SOPs for an activity in MPQA:

<Steps>
  <Step title="From the RACI Matrix (Recommended)">
    Navigate to your core process and go to the **RACI** tab.

    Find the activity you want to document and click the **"+ Add SOP"** button in the **Guides** column.

    The SOP tab opens automatically with the editor ready.
  </Step>

  <Step title="From the SOP Tab">
    Navigate to your core process and click the **SOP** tab in the top navigation.

    If no SOPs exist yet, you'll see a **Version History** sidebar showing "No versions yet" with a prompt to create your first SOP version.

    The main editor area displays: "Start documenting your standard operating procedure..."
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Creating Your First SOP

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the SOP Editor">
    Use either method above to access the SOP editor for an activity.

    You'll see a rich text editor similar to Google Docs or Microsoft Word, with a full menu bar and formatting toolbar.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Document Your Procedure">
    Write your SOP content using the editor. A comprehensive SOP typically includes:

    - **Purpose:** What this activity accomplishes and why it matters
    - **Prerequisites:** What needs to be done or available before starting
    - **Step-by-step instructions:** Detailed walkthrough of how to complete the activity
    - **Tools and resources:** Systems, templates, or documents needed
    - **Tips and best practices:** Important considerations or efficiency tips
    - **Common issues:** Troubleshooting guidance for typical problems
    - **Expected outcomes:** What success looks like when the activity is completed correctly

    Don't worry about making it perfect on the first try. You can always edit and create new versions.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Format Your Content">
    Use the editor's comprehensive formatting tools to make your SOP clear and readable:

    **From the menu bar:**
    - **File:** Document-level actions
    - **Edit:** Undo, redo, cut, copy, paste operations
    - **View:** Display and layout options
    - **Insert:** Add images, links, tables, special characters
    - **Format:** Text formatting, paragraph styles, alignment
    - **Tools:** Additional utilities and features
    - **Table:** Create and manage tables
    - **Help:** Editor assistance

    **From the toolbar:**
    - Heading levels (H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, H6)
    - Text formatting (bold, italic, underline, strikethrough)
    - Lists (bullets, numbers, indentation)
    - Alignment and spacing
    - Links, images, and tables
    - Text color and highlighting
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Comments (Optional)">
    Click the **"Add Comment"** button to leave notes or questions about specific parts of the SOP.

    Comments are useful for:
    - Collaborating with team members on documentation
    - Flagging sections that need review
    - Asking questions about unclear procedures
    - Suggesting improvements
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save Your SOP">
    Click the green **"Create SOP"** button in the bottom right corner.

    Your SOP is now saved and a new version appears in the Version History sidebar on the left.
  </Step>
</Steps>

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## SOP Content Structure

A well-organized SOP typically follows this structure:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="1. Activity Overview" icon="heading" defaultOpen>
    **What to include:**
    - Brief description of what the activity accomplishes
    - Why this activity is important to the overall process
    - Who typically performs this activity (reference RACI assignments)
    - Estimated time to complete

    **Example:** "This activity reviews incoming vendor contracts for legal compliance and pricing accuracy. It typically takes 2-3 hours and is performed by the Procurement Specialist before any contracts are signed."

    This gives readers immediate context before diving into detailed steps.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="2. Prerequisites & Requirements" icon="list-check">
    **What needs to be in place before starting:**
    - Completed prior activities
    - Required documents or information
    - System access or permissions needed
    - Tools or templates required

    **Examples:**
    - "Vendor must have submitted completed application form"
    - "Access to Contract Management System required"
    - "Legal review checklist template"
    - "Approval from department manager"

    This prevents people from starting the activity prematurely or discovering they're missing critical inputs halfway through.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="3. Step-by-Step Instructions" icon="list-ol">
    **The core of your SOP - detailed procedure:**

    Number each step clearly and use action verbs. Be specific about what to do, where to do it, and how to do it.

    **Format:**
    1. **[Action verb] [what]** - Brief explanation of how or additional details
    2. **[Action verb] [what]** - Include system names, field names, or specific locations
    3. **[Action verb] [what]** - Add any important considerations or warnings

    **Example:**
    1. **Open the Contract Management System** - Log in using your company credentials at contracts.company.com
    2. **Navigate to Pending Reviews** - Click "Contracts" in the left menu, then select "Pending Review" tab
    3. **Select the vendor contract** - Find the contract by vendor name or contract ID number
    4. **Review pricing terms** - Compare proposed pricing against approved budget in Section 3 of the contract
    5. **Check legal compliance** - Use the Legal Review Checklist to verify all required clauses are present

    For complex steps, add sub-bullets with additional details.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="4. Tools & Systems" icon="toolbox">
    **List everything needed to complete this activity:**

    **Systems and software:**
    - Contract Management System (link: contracts.company.com)
    - Vendor Database (link: vendors.company.com)
    - Document repository

    **Templates and forms:**
    - Legal Review Checklist (link to template)
    - Pricing Comparison Spreadsheet (link to template)
    - Approval Form (link to template)

    **Reference materials:**
    - Company procurement policy (link)
    - Legal compliance requirements (link)
    - Approved vendor list (link)

    Include direct links whenever possible so users can access resources with one click.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="5. Decision Points & Variations" icon="code-branch">
    **Handle different scenarios:**

    Many activities have decision points where the procedure varies based on circumstances.

    **Format:**
    - **If [condition], then [action]**
    - **If [different condition], then [different action]**

    **Example:**
    - **If contract value is under $10,000:** Procurement Specialist can approve directly
    - **If contract value is $10,000-$50,000:** Requires department manager approval
    - **If contract value is over $50,000:** Requires VP and Legal approval

    This prevents confusion when the standard procedure doesn't apply to every situation.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="6. Quality Checks" icon="circle-check">
    **How to verify the work was done correctly:**

    List the checks someone should perform before considering the activity complete.

    **Examples:**
    - All required fields in the system are filled out
    - Pricing is within approved budget range
    - Legal checklist shows 100% compliance
    - Appropriate approver has signed off
    - Vendor has been notified of decision

    These checkpoints help ensure quality and completeness.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="7. Common Issues & Solutions" icon="circle-question">
    **Troubleshooting guidance:**

    Document problems that frequently occur and how to resolve them.

    **Format:**
    **Issue:** [Description of the problem]

    **Examples:**

    **Issue:** Contract Management System shows "Access Denied" error
    **Solution:** Request access by submitting IT ticket to Procurement Admin group
    **Contact:** IT Helpdesk ext. 1234

    **Issue:** Vendor pricing exceeds approved budget
    **Solution:** Contact vendor to negotiate revised pricing or escalate to department manager for budget increase approval
    **Contact:** Procurement Manager ext. 5678

    This section grows over time as you encounter and solve new issues.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="8. Expected Outcomes" icon="bullseye">
    **What success looks like:**

    Describe the expected result when this activity is completed correctly.

    **Examples:**
    - Contract is approved and marked as "Ready for Signature" in the system
    - Vendor receives notification email of approval within 24 hours
    - All compliance requirements documented and filed
    - Next activity in the process is automatically triggered

    This helps people verify they've truly finished the activity and achieved the desired outcome.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="9. Tips & Best Practices" icon="lightbulb">
    **Efficiency and quality tips:**

    Share insights that make the activity easier, faster, or more effective.

</AccordionGroup>

## Using the Rich Text Editor

The SOP editor provides professional document formatting capabilities:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Headings" icon="heading">
    Use H1-H6 to create document hierarchy. Headings make long SOPs easy to scan and navigate.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Lists" icon="list">
    Bullet points for non-sequential items. Numbered lists for steps that must be done in order.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Text Formatting" icon="bold">
    Bold for emphasis, italic for definitions or references, underline sparingly for key terms.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Links" icon="link">
    Hyperlink to other SOPs, external resources, system URLs, or related documentation.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Tables" icon="table">
    Organize complex information like role assignments, comparisons, or decision matrices.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Images" icon="image">
    Add screenshots, diagrams, flowcharts, or photos to clarify complex instructions.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Formatting Best Practices

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Structure">
    **Use clear headings**
    
    Break your SOP into logical sections with descriptive headings (H2 or H3). This makes it easy to scan and find specific information quickly.

    **Keep paragraphs short**
    
    Aim for 2-3 sentences per paragraph. Long blocks of text are hard to follow and intimidating to read.

    **Number sequential steps**
    
    Use numbered lists for procedures that must be done in a specific order. Use bullets for items without required sequence.

    **Add whitespace**
    
    Leave blank lines between sections to improve readability and give readers' eyes a rest.

    **Use consistent formatting**
    
    If you bold field names, bold all field names. If you use quotes around system messages, use quotes consistently.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Clarity">
    **Use simple language**
    
    Write at an accessible reading level. Avoid unnecessary jargon, acronyms, or complex terminology. If technical terms are required, define them.

    **Be specific**
    
    "Contact John Smith at ext. 1234 within 24 hours" is better than "Contact someone soon." Give exact details: who, what, when, where, how.

    **Use active voice**
    
    "The recruiter schedules interviews" not "Interviews are scheduled by the recruiter." Active voice is clearer and more direct.

    **Be consistent with terminology**
    
    Use the same terms throughout your documentation. Don't alternate between "customer," "client," and "account" for the same concept.

    **Define acronyms on first use**
    
    "Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)" on first mention, then "SOP" afterwards.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Visual Elements">
    **Add screenshots**
    
    Show what systems, forms, or interfaces should look like. A screenshot of a correctly filled form is worth paragraphs of description.

    **Use callout boxes**
    
    Highlight warnings, tips, or important notes with Tip, Warning, Note, or Info boxes.

    **Include flowcharts**
    
    For activities with decision points or multiple paths, a flowchart clarifies the logic better than paragraphs.

    **Create tables**
    
    Use tables to organize comparative information, approval thresholds, or role responsibilities.

    **Annotate images**
    
    Add arrows, circles, or text to screenshots to draw attention to specific fields or buttons.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Version History

MPQA automatically tracks every version of your SOPs in the **Version History** sidebar:

**What's tracked:**
- All saved versions of the SOP
- Date and time each version was created
- Who created each version (if user tracking is enabled)

**Using Version History:**

**View past versions**

Click on any version in the Version History sidebar to view that version of the document. This is useful for reviewing what changed over time.

**Compare versions**

Review different versions to see how the procedure has evolved and what improvements have been made.

**Recover deleted content**

If you accidentally delete important content, you can view a previous version and copy the content back into the current version.

**Track changes over time**

See how the procedure has been refined and improved through multiple iterations.

<Tip>
Version History creates a complete audit trail of your documentation changes. This is especially valuable for compliance-heavy processes or when you need to demonstrate continuous improvement efforts.
</Tip>

## Writing Tips for Effective SOPs

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Start with an Outline" icon="list">
    Before writing, list the main sections you need to cover. This prevents rambling and ensures complete coverage.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Get Feedback Early" icon="comments">
    Share your draft with team members who actually perform the activity. Their practical experience will dramatically improve accuracy.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Test Your Instructions" icon="vial">
    Have someone unfamiliar with the activity try to follow your SOP. Where do they get confused? What questions do they ask?
  </Card>
  <Card title="Link, Don't Duplicate" icon="link">
    If detailed information exists elsewhere, link to it rather than copying. This prevents outdated duplicate information.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Common SOP Mistakes

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Too Much Detail" icon="microscope" defaultOpen>
    **Problem:** Documenting every mouse click and keystroke makes the SOP overwhelming and tedious to follow.

    **Example:** "Move your mouse to the top left corner of the screen. Click on the File menu. Move your mouse down to the Save option. Click on Save."

    **Fix:** Document what to do, not how to move your mouse. "Save the document (File > Save)" is sufficient. Focus on meaningful actions, not basic computer skills everyone should know.

    Save ultra-detailed "how-to" instructions for training materials or guides aimed at very inexperienced users.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Too Little Detail" icon="eye-slash">
    **Problem:** "Contact the vendor" doesn't tell someone who to contact, how to reach them, what to say, or when to do it.

    **Example:** "Review the contract and approve it." (How? Where? What should I check? What constitutes approval?)

    **Fix:** Provide enough detail that someone new to the role could complete the task successfully. "Review the contract in the Contract Management System, verify all items on the Legal Checklist are present, and click the 'Approve' button if compliant."

    Test: Could someone with no prior knowledge of this activity complete it using only your SOP?
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Outdated Information" icon="calendar-xmark">
    **Problem:** SOPs that reference old systems, departed employees, obsolete procedures, or broken links create confusion and undermine trust.

    **Example:** "Contact Mary in Accounting at ext. 1234" (Mary left the company 2 years ago)

    **Fix:** Review and update SOPs regularly. Replace people's names with role titles ("Contact the Accounting Manager"). Update system names when they change. Test all links quarterly. Set calendar reminders for SOP review.

    Archive obsolete versions rather than deleting them - they provide historical context.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="No Visual Aids" icon="image-slash">
    **Problem:** Long walls of text with no screenshots, diagrams, formatting, or structure are hard to read and follow.

    **Example:** A 5-page SOP that's one continuous paragraph with no headings, bullets, or images.

    **Fix:** Add headings to create sections. Use screenshots to show what interfaces look like. Include flowcharts for decision logic. Use tables for complex comparisons. Add whitespace between sections. Bold key terms or field names.

    Visual elements help people understand faster and reduce errors.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Inconsistent Terminology" icon="shuffle">
    **Problem:** Using different words for the same thing creates confusion about whether you're referring to different concepts.

    **Example:** Alternating between "customer," "client," "account," and "user" to refer to the same entity.

    **Fix:** Choose one term and use it consistently throughout the SOP. Create a glossary for your organization defining standard terms. When reviewing SOPs, do a search for synonyms and standardize them.

    Consistency makes documentation easier to read and reduces ambiguity.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## When to Update Your SOP

Update your SOP documentation when:

- **The activity procedure changes** - New steps added, steps removed, or sequence changed
- **Tools or systems change** - New software, system migrations, or interface updates
- **You discover better methods** - More efficient ways to complete the activity
- **Compliance requirements change** - New regulations, policies, or legal requirements
- **Team members ask repeated questions** - If multiple people ask the same thing, add it to the FAQ section
- **You find errors or unclear instructions** - Typos, inaccuracies, or confusing wording
- **Roles or responsibilities change** - Team reorganizations or RACI assignment updates

<Warning>
Don't wait for problems to occur. Set a calendar reminder to review each SOP at least quarterly, even if you don't think changes are needed. Fresh eyes often spot issues or improvement opportunities.
</Warning>

<Tip>
When updating an SOP, document what changed and why in a comment or revision note. This helps team members understand the evolution of the procedure and provides valuable context for future updates.
</Tip>
