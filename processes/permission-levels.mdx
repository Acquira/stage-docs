## Three Permission Levels

When you share a process, you choose what level of access each person gets. The Business Process Framework uses three standard permission levels that control what people can do with your processes.

<Info>
Think of permissions like levels of trust. View is "you can see it," Comment is "you can give feedback," and Edit is "you can change it."
</Info>

## The Three Levels

  <Card title="View" icon="eye" color="#3b82f6">
    **Can see, can't change**

    Read-only access to the process
  </Card>
  <Card title="Comment" icon="message" color="#10b981">
    **Can see and suggest**

    View access plus ability to add comments
  </Card>
  <Card title="Edit" icon="pen" color="#f59e0b">
    **Can change anything**

    Full access to modify the process
  </Card>

## Choosing the Right Permission Level

Ask yourself these questions:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Does this person perform activities in the process?">
    **Yes:** At minimum, give View permission so they can reference procedures.

    **No:** Consider if they need access at all.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Should this person help improve the process?">
    **Yes:** Give Comment permission so they can suggest improvements.

    **No:** View permission is sufficient.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Is this person responsible for maintaining documentation?">
    **Yes:** Give Edit permission so they can update as needed.

    **No:** Comment permission is probably enough.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Does this person need to control who else has access?">
    **Yes:** Give Edit permission (includes sharing rights).

    **No:** View or Comment is appropriate.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Permission Level Examples by Role

| Role | Typical Permission | Reason |
|------|-------------------|---------|
| **Process Owner** | Edit | Responsible for maintaining the process |
| **Team Lead/Manager** | Edit | Oversees the process and makes updates |
| **Team Members** | View | Follow the process but don't maintain it |
| **New Employees** | View | Learning the process, shouldn't edit yet |
| **Subject Matter Expert** | Comment | Provides valuable input but doesn't maintain docs |
| **Cross-Functional Partner** | Comment | Interacts with process, can suggest improvements |
| **Executive/Stakeholder** | View | Needs visibility but not control |
| **Auditor/Compliance** | View or Comment | Reviews for compliance, may suggest changes |
| **Consultant/Contractor** | View | Temporary access for specific projects |

## Changing Permissions

You can update someone's permission level at any time:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Share Settings">
    Click the Share button for the process.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Find the Person">
    Locate the team member in the access list.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Current Permission">
    Click on their current permission level (View, Comment, or Edit).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select New Permission">
    Choose the new permission level from the dropdown.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save">
    Changes take effect immediately. No need to notify the person unless you want to explain the change.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
**Common reason to change permissions:** Promoting someone from View to Comment as they gain experience, or from Comment to Edit when they become a process maintainer.
</Note>

## Permission Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Start Conservative" icon="shield">
    Give the minimum permission needed. It's easier to grant more access later than to restrict it.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Limit Editors" icon="users-slash">
    Too many people with Edit permission creates chaos. Limit to 2-4 maintainers per process.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Use Comment Freely" icon="comments">
    Comment permission is great for collaborative culture. People feel heard without risking accidental changes.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Review Regularly" icon="calendar-check">
    Audit permissions quarterly. Update as people's roles change or as they gain experience.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Common Permission Scenarios

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Scenario: Team Member Keeps Asking Questions" icon="comment-dots" defaultOpen>
    **Problem:** A team member with View permission constantly emails questions about the process.

    **Solution:** Upgrade them to Comment permission so they can ask questions directly in the process. This creates a knowledge base for others.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Scenario: Too Many Conflicting Edits" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    **Problem:** Multiple people with Edit permission are making conflicting changes.

    **Solution:** Reduce Edit permissions to just 1-2 process owners. Downgrade others to Comment so they can still suggest changes.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Scenario: Someone Left the Team" icon="user-minus">
    **Problem:** A former team member still has Edit permission after changing roles.

    **Solution:** Remove their access entirely or downgrade to View if they still need to reference the process occasionally.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Scenario: Want Feedback Before Implementing" icon="lightbulb">
    **Problem:** You want team input on a new process before finalizing it.

    **Solution:** Share with team members with Comment permission. Gather feedback via comments, then implement suggested changes.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Security Considerations

<Warning>
**Sensitive Processes**

For processes containing sensitive information (financials, compensation, legal, personal data):
- Limit sharing to only necessary people
- Use View permission by default
- Only grant Edit to trusted owners
- Regularly audit who has access
- Never use public sharing
</Warning>

<Warning>
**Compliance Processes**

For processes subject to audit or regulatory requirements:
- Track who has Edit permission
- Consider requiring approval for changes
- Document why people have access
- Review access during audits
- Use version control features
</Warning>

## Tips for Success

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Communicate Changes" icon="megaphone">
    When changing someone's permissions, let them know why. This prevents confusion.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Document Decision Criteria" icon="clipboard-list">
    Create guidelines for your team about who gets which permission level.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Trust Your Team" icon="handshake">
    Don't withhold Comment permission out of fear. Collaborative input improves processes.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Monitor Activity" icon="chart-line">
