## Why Record KPI Values?

Creating a KPI is just the first step. The real value comes from consistently tracking actual performance over time. Recording KPI values lets you:

- See if you're meeting your targets
- Spot trends (improving or declining)
- Identify when corrective action is needed
- Prove that process improvements are working

<Info>
Think of KPI tracking like checking your weight when dieting. One weigh-in doesn't tell you much. Tracking over time shows if you're making progress toward your goal.
</Info>

## Recording Your First Value

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Your KPI">
    Open the core process or activity that contains your KPI.

    Find the KPI in the metrics or performance section.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click Add Value or Record Data">
    Look for a button like:
    - **"Add Value"**
    - **"Record Data"**
    - **"Update"**
    - **"+"** icon next to the KPI

    Click it to open the data entry form.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter the Date">
    Select the date this measurement represents.

    **For:**
    - Daily KPIs: Use the specific day
    - Weekly KPIs: Use the last day of the week (e.g., Friday)
    - Monthly KPIs: Use the last day of the month
    - Quarterly KPIs: Use the last day of the quarter

    Most systems default to today's date.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter the Actual Value">
    Type in the measured value.

    **Examples:**
    - First response time: **2.3** (hours)
    - Customer satisfaction: **4.6** (score)
    - Conversion rate: **23** (percent)
    - Time to hire: **45** (days)

    Enter just the number. The system knows the units from your KPI definition.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Notes (Optional)">
    Include context about this measurement if relevant:
    - Unusual circumstances
    - Special events affecting the metric
    - Reasons for significant changes
    - Action taken in response

    **Example:** "Response time spiked due to system outage 6/15. Back to normal as of 6/16."

    Notes help future you understand what happened.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save the Value">
    Click **"Save"** or **"Submit"** to record the value.

    The system automatically:
    - Calculates status (green/yellow/red)
    - Updates charts and trends
    - Adds this data point to historical record
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Understanding Automatic Status

When you record a value, the system compares it to your thresholds and assigns a status color:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Green" icon="circle-check" color="#10b981">
    **Meeting or exceeding target**

    Keep doing what you're doing
  </Card>
  <Card title="Yellow" icon="triangle-exclamation" color="#f59e0b">
    **In warning zone**

    Pay attention, may need action
  </Card>
  <Card title="Red" icon="circle-xmark" color="#ef4444">
    **Below acceptable level**

    Action required
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

**Example:** First Response Time KPI (target: 2 hours)
- Record **1.5 hours** ‚Üí Status: **Green** ‚úÖ
- Record **2.8 hours** ‚Üí Status: **Yellow** ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Record **4.2 hours** ‚Üí Status: **Red** üî¥

</Tip>

## Where Data Comes From

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Manual Calculation">
    **You calculate the value from source data**

    **Process:**
    1. Gather relevant data (reports, logs, records)
    2. Apply your calculation formula
    3. Enter the result into the system

    **Example:** Calculate average support response time:
    - Export ticket data from support system

## Interpreting Trends

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Upward Trend" icon="arrow-trend-up" defaultOpen>
    **Values consistently increasing over time**

    **If higher is better** (e.g., satisfaction score): ‚úÖ Great! Keep it up.

    **If lower is better** (e.g., response time): ‚ö†Ô∏è Problem. Investigate why.

    **Action:** Understand what's driving the trend and respond accordingly.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Downward Trend" icon="arrow-trend-down">
    **Values consistently decreasing over time**

    **If higher is better** (e.g., sales conversion): ‚ö†Ô∏è Problem. Find root cause.

    **If lower is better** (e.g., defect rate): ‚úÖ Excellent. Document what improved it.

    **Action:** For positive trends, sustain the improvement. For negative, take corrective action.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Stable/Flat Trend" icon="minus">
    **Values staying relatively constant**

    **If in green zone:** ‚úÖ Good. Process is stable and meeting targets.

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Updating Historical Values

Need to correct a past entry?

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find the Value">
    Navigate to the KPI and open the historical data view.

    Find the date/value you need to correct.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click Edit">
    Look for an edit icon or "Edit" button next to the value.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Update the Value">
    Change the value to the correct number.

    Add a note explaining the correction.

    **Example:** "Corrected from 2.5 to 3.2. Original entry included test data by mistake."
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save Changes">
    Save the updated value.

    Charts and trends automatically recalculate.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
**Audit trail:** Some systems track who edits values and when. Don't abuse this to make performance look better than it is. Data integrity matters.
</Warning>

## Dealing with Missing Data

What if you can't record a value for a period?

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Skip It">
    **Don't record anything for that period**

    **When to use:**
    - System was down and data isn't available
    - Process wasn't operating that period
    - External factors made measurement impossible

    **Effect:** Gap in your chart, but no false data

    **Example:** "Customer satisfaction survey wasn't sent in July due to email system migration."
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Estimate">
    **Make a reasonable estimate and note it**

    **When to use:**
    - You need a complete dataset for analysis
    - You can make a reasonable approximation
    - The period is important for reporting

    **Effect:** Maintains continuity but less accurate

    **Example:** "Estimated based on partial week data. System was offline 2 days."

    Mark estimates clearly in notes.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Carry Forward">
    **Use previous period's value**

    **When to use:**
    - Metric doesn't change frequently
    - Rarely appropriate - use with caution

    **Effect:** Shows stability that may not be real

    Generally not recommended unless specifically appropriate for your metric.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Note>
**Best practice:** It's usually better to have a gap in data than to have inaccurate data. If you must estimate, clearly note it.
</Note>

## Taking Action on Red Status

When a KPI value is in the red zone:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Investigate Root Cause">
    Don't just note it's red. Find out why.

    - Review process execution
    - Check for unusual circumstances
    - Talk to team members
    - Look for patterns in historical data
  </Step>

  <Step title="Document Your Findings">
    Add notes to the KPI explaining what you discovered.

    This creates a knowledge base for future reference.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Take Corrective Action">
    Based on root cause, implement fixes:
    - Process improvements
    - Additional training
    - Resource adjustments
    - Tool or system changes
  </Step>

  <Step title="Monitor Results">
    Continue tracking to see if your corrective actions improve the metric.

    If not, try a different approach.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Share Lessons Learned">
    When you fix a red KPI, share what worked with your team.

    This builds organizational knowledge.
  </Step>
</Steps>
