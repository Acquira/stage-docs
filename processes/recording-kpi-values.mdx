## Why Record KPI Values?

Creating a KPI is just the first step. The real value comes from consistently tracking actual performance over time. Recording KPI values lets you:

- See if you're meeting your targets
- Spot trends (improving or declining)
- Identify when corrective action is needed
- Prove that process improvements are working

<Info>
Think of KPI tracking like checking your weight when dieting. One weigh-in doesn't tell you much. Tracking over time shows if you're making progress toward your goal.
</Info>

## Recording Your First Value

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to the KPIs Tab">
    Open the core process that contains your KPI and click the **"KPIs"** tab in the top navigation bar.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Find Your KPI">
    You will see a card for each KPI you have created (e.g., "5 - Number of sales calls per week").
    
    Click the **"Record Data"** button on the card for the KPI you want to update.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter Data in the Modal">
    This opens the **"Record Actual Value"** modal. Fill in the fields:
    - **Reporting Period***: Select the date this measurement represents.
    - **Actual Value***: Type in the measured value (e.g., "1" or "120").
    - **Notes (optional):** Add any context for this value.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Observe Status Preview">
    After entering an "Actual Value," the modal will show you an automatic **"Status Preview"**.
    
    The system calculates this by comparing your "Actual Value" to the "Target Goal" and shows you the status (e.g., "10% of goal" - **Red**).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save the Value">
    Click **"Save & Close"** (or "Save & Add Another") to record the value.

    The system adds this data point to the KPI's historical record and updates its card.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Understanding Automatic Status

When you record a value, the system compares it to your "Target Goal" and automatically assigns a status color based on its internal rules.

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Green" icon="circle-check" color="#10b981">
    **Meeting or exceeding target**

    Keep doing what you're doing
  </Card>
  <Card title="Yellow" icon="triangle-exclamation" color="#f59e0b">
    **In warning zone**

    Pay attention, may need action
  </Card>
  <Card title="Red" icon="circle-xmark" color="#ef4444">
    **Below acceptable level**

    Action required
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

**Example:** A KPI has a Goal of 10 and "Higher is Better".
- Record **11** → Status: **Green**
- Record **8** → Status: **Yellow**
- Record **1** → Status: **Red**

## Recording Frequency

Stick to the frequency you defined when creating the KPI:

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Weekly KPIs" icon="calendar-week">
    **Record once per week**

    **Examples:**
    - Weekly sales pipeline
    - Average project completion time
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Monthly KPIs" icon="calendar">

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
**Set reminders:** Use calendar reminders or task management tools to prompt you when it's time to record KPI values. Consistency is key to useful data.
</Tip>

## Where Data Comes From

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Manual Calculation">
    **You calculate the value from source data**

    **Process:**
    1. Gather relevant data (reports, logs, records)
    2. Apply your calculation formula
    3. Enter the result into the system

    **Example:** Calculate average support response time:
    - Export ticket data from support system
    - Calculate: Total response time ÷ Number of tickets
    - Enter average into KPI tracker
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="System Reports">
    **Pull value from existing system reports**

    **Process:**
    1. Open the relevant system (CRM, support platform, etc.)
    2. Run the standard report
    3. Find the metric value
    4. Enter into KPI tracker
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Automated Integration">
    **System automatically pulls data**

    **Process:**
    1. Set up integration between data source and KPI tracker
    2. Values update automatically
    3. Review for accuracy periodically
  </Tab>

## Interpreting Trends

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Upward Trend" icon="arrow-trend-up" defaultOpen>
    **Values consistently increasing over time**

    **If 'Higher is Better'**: Great! Keep it up.

    **If 'Lower is Better'**: Problem. Investigate why.

    **Action:** Understand what's driving the trend and respond accordingly.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Downward Trend" icon="arrow-trend-down">
    **Values consistently decreasing over time**

    **If 'Higher is Better'**: Problem. Find root cause.

    **If 'Lower is Better'**: Excellent. Document what improved it.

    **Action:** For positive trends, sustain the improvement. For negative, take corrective action.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Stable/Flat Trend" icon="minus">
    **Values staying relatively constant**

    **If in Green zone:** Good. Process is stable and meeting targets.

    **If in Yellow/Red zone:** Concerning. You're consistently not meeting goals.

    **Action:** If stable in Green, maintain. If stable below target, process change needed.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Volatile/Erratic" icon="wave-square">
    **Values jumping up and down with no pattern**

    **Possible causes:**
    - Inconsistent process execution
    - External factors affecting measurement
    - Measurement error
    - Seasonal variation

    **Action:** Investigate why performance is inconsistent. Look for patterns in notes.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Updating Historical Values

Need to correct a past entry?

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find the Value">
    Navigate to the KPI and click **"View Records"**.

    Find the date/value you need to correct in the data table.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click Edit">
    Look for an edit icon or "Edit" button next to the value.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Update the Value">
    Change the value to the correct number.

    Add a note explaining the correction.

    **Example:** "Corrected from 2.5 to 3.2. Original entry included test data by mistake."
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save Changes">
    Save the updated value.

    Charts and trends automatically recalculate.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
**Audit trail:** Some systems track who edits values and when. Don't abuse this to make performance look better than it is. Data integrity matters.
</Warning>

## Dealing with Missing Data

What if you can't record a value for a period?

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Skip It">
    **Don't record anything for that period**

    **When to use:**
    - System was down and data isn't available
    - Process wasn't operating that period
    - External factors made measurement impossible

    **Effect:** Gap in your chart, but no false data
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Estimate">
    **Make a reasonable estimate and note it**

    **When to use:**
    - You need a complete dataset for analysis
    - You can make a reasonable approximation
    - The period is important for reporting

    **Effect:** Maintains continuity but less accurate
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Carry Forward">
    **Use previous period's value**

    **When to use:**
    - Metric doesn't change frequently
    - Rarely appropriate - use with caution

    **Effect:** Shows stability that may not be real
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Note>
**Best practice:** It's usually better to have a gap in data than to have inaccurate data. If you must estimate, clearly note it.
</Note>

## Taking Action on Red Status

When a KPI value is in the Red zone:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Investigate Root Cause">
    Don't just note it's red. Find out why.

    - Review process execution
    - Check for unusual circumstances
    - Talk to team members
    - Look for patterns in historical data
  </Step>

  <Step title="Document Your Findings">
    Add notes to the KPI record explaining what you discovered.

    This creates a knowledge base for future reference.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Take Corrective Action">
    Based on root cause, implement fixes:
    - Process improvements
    - Additional training
    - Resource adjustments
    - Tool or system changes
  </Step>

  <Step title="Monitor Results">
    Continue tracking to see if your corrective actions improve the metric.

    If not, try a different approach.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Share Lessons Learned">
    When you fix a red KPI, share what worked with your team.

    This builds organizational knowledge.
  </Step>
</Steps>
