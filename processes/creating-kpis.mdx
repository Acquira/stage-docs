## Before You Create a KPI

Creating good KPIs requires thoughtful planning. Before jumping in, ask yourself:

- **What does success look like** for this process?
- **What number would tell you** if the process is working?
- **Can you realistically measure** this metric?
- **Will tracking this help** you make better decisions?

<Info>
The best KPIs directly connect to your process goals. If improving this number means the process is working better, it's probably a good KPI.

## Choosing What to Measure

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start with Process Goals" icon="bullseye" defaultOpen>
    What is this process trying to accomplish?

    **Example:** Your customer onboarding process aims to get new customers successfully using your product.

    **Possible KPIs:**
    - Time to first login
    - % of customers who complete setup
    - Satisfaction score after first week
    - Support tickets during onboarding
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Identify Success Factors" icon="star">
    What factors determine if this process succeeds or fails?

    **Example:** For a hiring process, success means hiring great people quickly.

    **Success factors:**
    - Speed (time to hire)
    - Quality (new hire performance ratings)
    - Efficiency (cost per hire)
    - Fit (retention rate in first year)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Focus on What You Control" icon="hand">
    Choose metrics you can actually influence through process improvements.

    **Good:** Time to respond to support tickets (you control this)
    **Bad:** Industry-wide customer satisfaction (you don't control this)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Balance Multiple Perspectives" icon="scale-balanced">
    Consider different dimensions:
    - **Speed:** How fast?
    - **Quality:** How well?
    - **Cost:** How efficiently?
    - **Satisfaction:** How happy are stakeholders?

    Don't focus on just one dimension.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Creating Your First KPI

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Your Process">
    Open the core process or activity where you want to add a KPI.

    KPIs can be attached to:
    - Entire core processes (overall performance)
    - Specific activities (detailed metrics)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Find the KPI Section">
    Look for "KPIs," "Metrics," or "Performance" section.

    Click **"Add KPI"** or **"Create Metric"** button.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Name Your KPI">
    Choose a clear, descriptive name that immediately tells people what you're measuring.

    **Good names:**
    - "First Response Time (Hours)"
    - "Customer Satisfaction Score (1-5)"
    - "Time to Hire (Days)"
    - "Order Accuracy Rate (%)"

    **Poor names:**
    - "Metric 1"
    - "Speed"
    - "Customer Happiness"

    Include units in the name (hours, days, %, score, etc.)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Write a Clear Definition">
    Explain exactly what you're measuring and how it's calculated.

    **Example for "First Response Time":**
    > "Average time in hours between customer submitting a support ticket and receiving our first response. Measured from ticket creation timestamp to first agent reply timestamp. Calculated daily using all tickets from the previous 24 hours."

    Be specific enough that anyone could measure it consistently.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Your Target">
    What number are you aiming for?

    **Consider:**
    - Current performance (baseline)
    - Industry benchmarks
    - Customer expectations
    - Business requirements
    - Resource constraints

    **Example:** If current first response time is 4 hours, target might be 2 hours.

    Be ambitious but realistic.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Define Thresholds">
    Set the boundaries for green (good), yellow (warning), and red (problem) status.

    **Example for First Response Time (target: 2 hours):**
    - **Green:** 2 hours or less
    - **Yellow:** 2-3 hours
    - **Red:** Over 3 hours

    Learn more: [KPI Status Colors](/processes/kpi-status-colors)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Measurement Frequency">
    How often will you record this metric?

    **Options:**
    - **Real-time:** Continuously updated (automated systems)
    - **Daily:** Recorded every day
    - **Weekly:** Recorded once per week
    - **Monthly:** Recorded once per month
    - **Quarterly:** Recorded every 3 months

    Choose based on:
    - How fast the metric changes
    - How critical it is
    - How easy it is to measure
  </Step>

  <Step title="Assign an Owner">
    Who is responsible for tracking and reporting this KPI?

    This should be:
    - Someone with access to the data
    - Someone accountable for the process
    - Typically a manager or team lead

    **Example:** Customer Support Manager owns all support-related KPIs
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Context (Optional)">
    Include additional helpful information:
    - **Data source:** Where the numbers come from
    - **Calculation method:** Formula or process for calculating
    - **Reporting format:** How results are shared
    - **Related KPIs:** Other metrics that connect to this one

    **Example:** "Data pulled from Zendesk reporting dashboard. Exported weekly on Mondays. Shared in weekly ops meeting."
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save Your KPI">
    Click **"Save"** or **"Create"** to add the KPI to your process.

    You can now start recording values and tracking performance.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Setting Realistic Targets

<Steps>
  <Step title="Measure Current Performance">
    Before setting a target, know where you are now. This is your baseline.

    Track the metric for at least 2-4 weeks to get a true average.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Research Benchmarks">
    Look at:
    - Industry standards
    - Competitor performance (if available)
    - Best-in-class examples
    - Your own historical data

    This gives context for what's achievable.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Consider Resources">
    Can you realistically hit the target with:
    - Current staff levels
    - Existing tools and systems
    - Available budget
    - Time constraints

    Don't set targets that require resources you don't have.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Stretch Goals">
    Targets should be challenging but achievable.

    **Too easy:** Current performance is 4 hours, target is 3.9 hours (no real improvement)
    **Too hard:** Current performance is 4 hours, target is 30 minutes (impossible)
    **Just right:** Current performance is 4 hours, target is 2 hours (significant improvement, achievable with effort)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Phase Improvements">
    For major improvements, set intermediate milestones.

    **Example:**
    - Current: 4 hours
    - Q1 target: 3 hours
    - Q2 target: 2.5 hours
    - Q3 target: 2 hours (final goal)

    This makes big improvements manageable.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
**Use the 80/20 rule:** Initial improvements are usually easier than later ones. Getting from 4 hours to 3 hours might be easy; getting from 2.5 hours to 2 hours requires more effort.
</Tip>

## Common KPI Mistakes

<Warning>
**Measuring Too Much**

Don't create a KPI for everything. Focus on the vital few metrics that truly indicate success.

**Fix:** Limit to 2-5 KPIs per process. More than that becomes unmanageable.
</Warning>

<Warning>
**Vanity Metrics**

Don't track metrics that look impressive but don't drive real improvement.

**Example:** Total website visitors (vanity) vs. conversion rate (actionable)

**Fix:** Ask "If this number improves, does our process actually get better?"
</Warning>

<Warning>
**Unmeasurable KPIs**

Don't create KPIs you can't actually track consistently.

**Example:** "Customer happiness" (vague) vs. "Customer satisfaction score from surveys" (measurable)

**Fix:** Ensure you have a reliable way to collect the data.
</Warning>

<Warning>
**Gaming the System**

Be careful of KPIs that incentivize bad behavior.

**Example:** Measuring only "tickets closed" might cause agents to close tickets prematurely without solving problems.

**Fix:** Balance multiple metrics. Add "resolution quality" or "customer satisfaction" alongside "tickets closed."
</Warning>

<Warning>
**Ignoring Context**

Don't set the same target for all situations if context varies.

**Example:** Response time targets might differ for "Critical" vs. "Low Priority" tickets.

**Fix:** Create separate KPIs for different categories or add context to definitions.
</Warning>
