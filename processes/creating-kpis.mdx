## Before You Create a KPI

Creating good KPIs requires thoughtful planning. Before jumping in, ask yourself:

- **What does success look like** for this process?
- **What number would tell you** if the process is working?
- **Can you realistically measure** this metric?
- **Will tracking this help** you make better decisions?

<Info>
The best KPIs directly connect to your process goals. If improving this number means the process is working better, it's probably a good KPI.

## Choosing What to Measure

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start with Process Goals" icon="bullseye" defaultOpen>
    What is this process trying to accomplish?

    **Example:** Your customer onboarding process aims to get new customers successfully using your product.

    **Possible KPIs:**
    - Time to first login
    - % of customers who complete setup
    - Satisfaction score after first week
    - Support tickets during onboarding
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Identify Success Factors" icon="star">
    What factors determine if this process succeeds or fails?

    **Example:** For a hiring process, success means hiring great people quickly.

    **Success factors:**
    - Speed (time to hire)
    - Quality (new hire performance ratings)
    - Efficiency (cost per hire)
    - Fit (retention rate in first year)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Focus on What You Control" icon="hand">
    Choose metrics you can actually influence through process improvements.

    **Good:** Time to respond to support tickets (you control this)
    **Bad:** Industry-wide customer satisfaction (you don't control this)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Balance Multiple Perspectives" icon="scale-balanced">
    Consider different dimensions:
    - **Speed:** How fast?
    - **Quality:** How well?
    - **Cost:** How efficiently?
    - **Satisfaction:** How happy are stakeholders?

    Don't focus on just one dimension.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Setting Realistic Targets

<Steps>
  <Step title="Measure Current Performance">
    Before setting a goal, know where you are now. This is your baseline.

    Track the metric for at least 2-4 weeks to get a true average.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Research Benchmarks">
    Look at:
    - Industry standards
    - Competitor performance (if available)
    - Best-in-class examples
    - Your own historical data

    This gives context for what's achievable.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Consider Resources">
    Can you realistically hit the target with:
    - Current staff levels
    - Existing tools and systems
    - Available budget
    - Time constraints

    Don't set goals that require resources you don't have.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Stretch Goals">
    Targets (Goal Values) should be challenging but achievable.

    **Too easy:** Current performance is 4 hours, goal is 3.9 hours (no real improvement)
    **Too hard:** Current performance is 4 hours, goal is 30 minutes (impossible)
    **Just right:** Current performance is 4 hours, goal is 2 hours (significant improvement, achievable with effort)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Phase Improvements">
    For major improvements, set intermediate milestones.

    **Example:**
    - Current: 4 hours
    - Q1 goal: 3 hours
    - Q2 goal: 2.5 hours
    - Q3 goal: 2 hours (final goal)
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
**Use the 80/20 rule:** Initial improvements are usually easier than later ones. Getting from 4 hours to 3 hours might be easy; getting from 2.5 hours to 2 hours requires more effort.
</Tip>

## Common KPI Mistakes

<Warning>
**Measuring Too Much**

Don't create a KPI for everything. Focus on the vital few metrics that truly indicate success.

**Fix:** Limit to 2-5 KPIs per process. More than that becomes unmanageable.
</Warning>

<Warning>
**Vanity Metrics**

Don't track metrics that look impressive but don't drive real improvement.

**Example:** Total website visitors (vanity) vs. conversion rate (actionable)

**Fix:** Ask "If this number improves, does our process actually get better?"
</Warning>

<Warning>
**Unmeasurable KPIs**

Don't create KPIs you can't actually track consistently.

**Example:** "Customer happiness" (vague) vs. "Customer satisfaction score from surveys" (measurable)

**Fix:** Ensure you have a reliable way to collect the data in the "How will you measure it?" field.
</Warning>

<Warning>
**Gaming the System**

Be careful of KPIs that incentivize bad behavior.

**Example:** Measuring only "tickets closed" might cause agents to close tickets prematurely without solving problems.

**Fix:** Balance multiple metrics. Add "resolution quality" or "customer satisfaction" alongside "tickets closed."
</Warning>
