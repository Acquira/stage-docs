## What Are Activities?

Activities are the individual tasks that make up your core process. They're the actual work that gets done - the "doing" level of your business.

Activities are Level 4 in the four-level framework. This is where you document the specific steps your team takes to complete a process.

<Info>
Think of activities as the line items on a checklist. Each activity represents one distinct task or action in your process.
</Info>

## Before You Add Activities

Make sure you have:

- **A core process created** - Activities belong to core processes
- **Categories defined** (optional but recommended) - Categories help organize activities
- **A clear understanding** of the steps in your process

<Tip>
Write down your process steps on paper first. It's easier to organize your thoughts before entering them into the system.
</Tip>

## Creating Your First Activity

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Your Core Process">
    Navigate to the core process where you want to add activities.

    If you've created categories, you'll see them listed. If not, you'll see an empty activities section.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose a Category (If Using)">
    If you're using categories, click on the category where this activity belongs.

    If you're not using categories, skip this step.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click Add Activity">
    Look for the **"Add Activity"** button or **"+"** icon.

    This is usually at the bottom of the category or at the top of the activities list.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Name Your Activity">
    Give your activity a clear, action-oriented name using a verb.

    **Good names:**
    - "Review job applications"
    - "Send follow-up email"
    - "Approve budget request"
    - "Schedule kickoff meeting"

    **Poor names:**
    - "Applications" (not a verb)
    - "Do the thing" (too vague)
    - "Step 1" (not descriptive)

    <Tip>
    Start activity names with an action verb (review, send, approve, create, update, analyze, etc.)
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add a Description (Optional)">
    Add a brief description explaining what this activity involves.

    **Example:** "Review all submitted applications to ensure candidates meet minimum qualifications. Flag standout candidates for phone screening."

    Descriptions help team members understand the activity without opening full documentation.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Additional Properties (Optional)">
    Depending on your system, you may be able to set:
    - **Estimated time:** How long this activity typically takes
    - **Priority:** High, medium, or low
    - **Frequency:** How often this activity occurs
    - **Dependencies:** Activities that must happen first

    Fill these in if available, or skip for now.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save the Activity">
    Click **"Save"** or **"Create"** to add your activity.

    Your activity appears in the list, ready for you to add RACI assignments and documentation.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Activity Properties Explained

    The position of this activity in your process. You can reorder activities using drag-and-drop or up/down arrows.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Reordering Activities

Activities should be listed in the order they're performed. You can easily change the order:

### Drag and Drop

<Steps>
  <Step title="Hover Over Activity">
    Move your mouse over the activity you want to move. A drag handle (usually dots or lines) appears.

  </Step>
</Steps>

### Move Buttons

If drag-and-drop isn't available:

1. Click the up/down arrows next to the activity
2. Each click moves the activity one position
3. Continue until the activity is where you want it

<Info>
When you reorder activities, visual diagrams and exports automatically update to reflect the new sequence.
</Info>

## Moving Activities Between Categories

If you need to move an activity to a different category:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Activity Edit Mode">
    Click the edit icon (pencil) next to the activity.

  <Step title="Change Category">
    Select a different category from the dropdown menu.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save Changes">
    Click "Save" to move the activity.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
Some systems allow drag-and-drop between categories. Try dragging an activity from one category to another.
</Note>

## Activity Naming Best Practices

  <Card title="Be Specific" icon="bullseye">
    "Review applications for technical skills" vs. "Review stuff"
  </Card>
  <Card title="Keep It Short" icon="minimize">
    3-6 words is ideal. Save details for the description.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Use Consistent Language" icon="equals">
    If one activity is "Send email," don't name another "Email is sent"
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Examples by Action Type

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Communication">
    - Send proposal to client

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## How Many Activities Should You Have?

There's no perfect number, but use these guidelines:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Too Few Activities (Under 5)" icon="down-long" defaultOpen>
    If your process has fewer than 5 activities, it might be too high-level. Consider:
    - Breaking down activities into smaller, more specific steps
    - Adding activities you're currently doing informally
    - Checking if this should be an activity within a larger process
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Just Right (5-30)" icon="check">
    Most core processes have between 5 and 30 activities. This is:
    - Detailed enough to be useful
    - Not so detailed that it becomes overwhelming
    - Easy to understand and follow
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Too Many Activities (Over 50)" icon="up-long">
    If your process has more than 50 activities, consider:
    - Combining very similar activities
    - Breaking the process into multiple smaller core processes
    - Moving some activities to sub-processes
    - Checking if you're documenting things that are too granular
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Warning>
**Don't document every mouse click.** Activities should be meaningful tasks, not micro-steps. "Send email" is good; "Open email client, click compose, type subject line..." is too detailed.
</Warning>

## Common Activity Patterns

Different processes have different activity patterns:

| Process Type | Typical Pattern | Example Activities |
|--------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Linear Process** | A → B → C → D | Each activity leads to the next in sequence |
| **Approval Process** | Submit → Review → Approve → Execute | Clear gates and decision points |
| **Cyclical Process** | Plan → Execute → Review → Adjust (repeat) | Ongoing processes with iterations |
| **Parallel Process** | A1, A2, A3 → B → C | Multiple activities happen simultaneously |

## Editing Activities

Need to update an activity after creating it?

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find the Activity">
    Locate the activity in your process view.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open Edit Mode">
    Click the edit icon (pencil) or three-dot menu next to the activity.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Make Changes">
    Update the name, description, category, or any other properties.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save">
    Click "Save" to apply your changes.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
Changes to activities automatically update everywhere they appear, including diagrams, reports, and shared views.
</Info>

## Deleting Activities

<Warning>
**Be careful when deleting activities.** This may also delete:
- RACI assignments
- Associated documentation (SOPs, guides)
- KPI assignments
- Historical data

Some systems move deleted activities to a trash/archive instead of permanently deleting them. Check your system's behavior before deleting.
</Warning>

To delete an activity:

1. Click the three-dot menu or delete icon next to the activity
2. Select "Delete" or "Remove"
3. Confirm the deletion when prompted

## Duplicating Activities

If you have similar activities, you can duplicate one and modify it:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find the Activity to Copy">
    Locate an activity similar to what you need.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open Menu">
    Click the three-dot menu next to the activity.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Duplicate">
    Choose "Duplicate" or "Copy" from the menu.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Edit the Copy">
    Update the duplicated activity's name and details to match what you need.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Duplicating is great for activities that follow a pattern, like "Conduct phone screen" and "Conduct final interview" which have similar structures but different details.
</Tip>

## Activity Checklist

Before moving on, make sure each activity has:

- [ ] A clear, verb-based name
- [ ] The correct category (if using categories)
- [ ] Proper sequence/order
- [ ] A description (if the name isn't self-explanatory)
- [ ] Realistic estimated time (optional)

## Tips for Success

  </Card>
  <Card title="Test Your Process" icon="vial">
    Walk through the activities in order. Do they make sense? Are any missing?
  </Card>
  <Card title="Get Team Input" icon="users">
    Have team members review the activities to ensure nothing is missing or unclear.
  </Card>

    As you use the process, you'll discover activities to add, combine, or remove.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

<Warning>
**Activities That Are Too Vague**

"Do research" doesn't tell anyone what to do. "Research competitor pricing for Q4 report" is specific and actionable.
</Warning>

<Warning>
**Mixing Different Levels of Detail**

Don't have "Complete entire hiring process" next to "Send one email." Keep activities at a similar level of granularity.
</Warning>

<Warning>
**Forgetting Dependencies**

If Activity B can't start until Activity A is done, make sure the order reflects that. Don't list activities alphabetically.
</Warning>

<Warning>
**Including "Nice to Have" Activities**

Only include activities that actually happen in your process. Don't document what you wish you did; document what you actually do.
</Warning>
