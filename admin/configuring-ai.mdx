<Note>
This feature is available to **Team Admins** and **Team Owners** only.
</Note>

## Overview

**Stage3** uses OpenAI's GPT models to provide intelligent assistance. As an administrator, you need to configure AI settings to enable these features for your team.

AI configuration involves:
- Connecting your OpenAI API key
- Selecting default AI models
- Troubleshooting connection issues

<Info>
AI features require an active OpenAI API key with available credits. You can obtain an API key from [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com).
</Info>

<Tip>
**Quick Access:** If you see a yellow warning banner at the bottom of your sidebar that says `Configure AI API keys`, you can click it to go directly to the API configuration page.
</Tip>

## Setting Up OpenAI API Keys

<Steps>
  <Step title="Obtain an OpenAI API Key">
    1. Go to [OpenAI's platform](https://platform.openai.com)
    2. Sign in or create an account
    3. Navigate to **API Keys** in your account settings
    4. Click **Create new secret key**
    5. Give your key a name (e.g., "Stage3 Production")
    6. Copy the API key immediately (you cannot view it again)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Navigate to API Keys">
    In the main sidebar, go to **Administration > Team Settings**. On the "Settings" page, select **API Keys** from the secondary menu (under Profile, Password, and Team).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter Your API Key">
    Paste your OpenAI API key into the **API Key** field.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Default Settings">
    After verification, set your default AI preferences:
    - **Default model**: Choose GPT-4o, GPT-4-turbo, etc.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test and Save">
    Click **Test Connection** to verify the key works.
    Click **Save** to activate the AI assistant for your organization.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
Your API key provides access to your OpenAI account and incurs costs based on usage. Store it securely and never share it publicly.
</Warning>

## Default AI Models

**Stage3** supports multiple OpenAI models:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="GPT-4 Turbo" icon="brain">
    **Best for: Complex analysis**

    Most capable model with superior reasoning and context understanding. Higher cost per token.

    **Use cases**: Strategic recommendations, complex process analysis, detailed assessments
  </Card>

  <Card title="GPT-3.5 Turbo" icon="bolt">
    **Best for: General assistance**

    Fast and cost-effective for most tasks. Excellent balance of capability and efficiency.

    **Use cases**: Process documentation, routine suggestions, quick insights
  </Card>

  <Card title="GPT-4o" icon="sparkles">
    **Best for: Balanced performance**

    Optimized version of GPT-4 with improved speed and lower cost. Great all-around choice.

    **Use cases**: Most team operations, assessments, workflow assistance
  </Card>

  <Card title="GPT-4o Mini" icon="gauge-high">
    **Best for: High volume**

    Lightweight model optimized for speed and cost. Perfect for high-frequency operations.

    **Use cases**: Auto-suggestions, tags, simple completions
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Choosing a Default Model

Consider these factors when selecting your default model:

- **Budget**: GPT-3.5 Turbo is most cost-effective
- **Quality needs**: GPT-4 provides best results for complex tasks
- **Response time**: Smaller models respond faster

<Tip>
Start with GPT-4o as your default. It provides excellent quality at a reasonable cost. You can switch to a different model later if you want to optimize costs.
</Tip>

## Understanding Token Usage

Tokens are the units that OpenAI uses to measure usage. Roughly:
- 1 token ≈ 4 characters of English text
- 1,000 tokens ≈ 750 words
- A typical process document uses 500-2,000 tokens
- An AI conversation might use 2,000-10,000 tokens

**Pricing examples** (approximate):
- GPT-3.5 Turbo: $0.50-$2.00 per 1M tokens
- GPT-4o: $2.50-$10.00 per 1M tokens
- GPT-4 Turbo: $10-$30 per 1M tokens

## Monitoring AI Usage

<Accordion title="Monitoring Usage and Costs">
To monitor your usage and set spending limits, you must use your **OpenAI Dashboard**.

1.  Log into [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com) and go to **Usage**.
2.  View your daily/monthly token usage and cost breakdown.
3.  In your OpenAI account settings, set **Usage Limits** (soft or hard limits) to prevent overages.
</Accordion>

## Troubleshooting AI Connection

### Connection Failed ("Invalid API Key")

If your API key verification fails:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Verify API Key Format">
    OpenAI API keys start with `sk-` followed by a long string. Ensure you copied the entire key.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Check API Key Status">
    Go to OpenAI's platform and verify the API key is active and not revoked.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify Account Credits">
    Ensure your OpenAI account has available credits or a valid payment method.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test API Key Directly">
    Use OpenAI's playground to test if your API key works outside the application.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### AI Features Not Working

If AI features are not responding:

- **Check connection status**: Go to the API Keys page and re-test the connection.
- **Review usage limits**: Ensure you have not exceeded your spending limits in your OpenAI account.
- **Check OpenAI status**: Visit [status.openai.com](https://status.openai.com) for service issues.

### Slow AI Responses

If AI responses are taking too long:

- **Switch to faster model**: Try GPT-3.5 Turbo.
- **Check OpenAI load**: Response times vary with OpenAI's server load.
- **Break complex questions** into simpler parts.

### High Costs

If your AI costs are higher than expected:

1. **Review usage dashboard** in OpenAI to identify which models consume the most tokens.
2. **Switch to cheaper models**: Consider GPT-3.5 Turbo for routine tasks.
3. **Set stricter limits** in your OpenAI account.

<Warning>
OpenAI charges based on actual token usage. Monitor your usage dashboard regularly to avoid unexpected costs.
</Warning>

## Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Monitor Usage Weekly" icon="chart-line">
    Review your OpenAI usage dashboard weekly to catch unusual patterns or cost spikes early.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Set Conservative Limits" icon="shield-halved">
    Start with lower spending limits in OpenAI and increase them as you understand your team's usage.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Rotate API Keys" icon="key">
    Periodically regenerate your API key for security, especially if team membership changes.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Use Appropriate Models" icon="sliders">
    Do not use GPT-4 for simple tasks that GPT-3.5 can handle effectively.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Security Considerations

### API Key Security

- **Storage**: Your API key is encrypted at rest in our database
- **Transmission**: All API communications use HTTPS encryption
- **Access**: Only Team Admins and Owners can view or update the API key
- **Auditing**: All API key changes are logged in the activity log

### Data Privacy

- **OpenAI processing**: Your data is sent to OpenAI for processing
- **Retention**: OpenAI does not use your data to train models (as of API usage terms)
- **Compliance**: Review OpenAI's privacy policy to ensure compliance with your requirements
- **Sensitive data**: Avoid including personally identifiable information (PII) in AI requests

<Info>
For sensitive or regulated industries, review OpenAI's data processing agreements and consider whether AI features are appropriate for your use case.
