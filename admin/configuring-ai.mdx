Set a maximum number of tokens your team can use per month:

- **Soft limit**: Sends warning email at threshold
- **Hard limit**: Disables AI features when reached
- **Recommended**: Set to 2-3x your expected usage

### Per-User Daily Limit

Prevent individual users from consuming excessive tokens:

- **Default**: 50,000 tokens per user per day
- **Recommended**: 10,000-100,000 depending on team size and usage
- **Effect**: User receives a notification when limit is reached

### Cost Alerts

Receive notifications when costs exceed thresholds:

- **Alert levels**: 50%, 75%, 90%, 100% of monthly budget
- **Recipients**: Team Owners and Admins
- **Delivery**: Email and in-app notifications

<Accordion title="Understanding Token Usage">
Tokens are the units that OpenAI uses to measure usage. Roughly:
- 1 token ≈ 4 characters of English text
- 1,000 tokens ≈ 750 words
- A typical process document uses 500-2,000 tokens
- An AI conversation might use 2,000-10,000 tokens

**Pricing examples** (approximate):
- GPT-3.5 Turbo: $0.50-$2.00 per 1M tokens
- GPT-4o: $2.50-$10.00 per 1M tokens
- GPT-4 Turbo: $10-$30 per 1M tokens
</Accordion>
