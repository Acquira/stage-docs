<Note>
This feature is available to **Team Admins** and **Team Owners** only.
</Note>

## Overview

Removing a team member revokes their access to your team and all associated processes, workflows, and data. This is an important administrative function that should be used carefully and deliberately.

## When to Remove Team Members

You should remove a team member when:

- They have left your organization
- They no longer need access to the platform
- Their contract or engagement has ended
- They have violated team policies
- They have requested account removal
- You are consolidating or restructuring your team

<Warning>
Removing a team member is immediate and cannot be undone. If you remove someone by mistake, you will need to invite them again as a new member.
</Warning>

## How to Remove a Team Member

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Team Settings">
    Go to **Administration > Team Settings** to view your team roster in the "Team Members" section.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Locate the Team Member">
    Find the member you want to remove in the members list.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click the 'Actions' Icon">
    In the "Actions" column for that member's row, click the **Delete** (trash can) icon.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review the Impact">
    A dialog will appear showing what content this member owns or is assigned to. Review this information carefully.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose Content Handling">
    Decide how to handle the member's content:
    - **Reassign to another member**: Transfer ownership to a specific team member
    - **Reassign to you**: Take ownership of all their content
    - **Archive content**: Keep content but mark as archived (recommended for processes)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Confirm Removal">
    Type the member's email address to confirm you want to remove them, then click **Remove Member**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

The member is immediately removed and will no longer be able to access your team.

## What Happens to Their Content

When you remove a team member, their content is handled based on your choices:

### Processes

- **Owned processes**: Transferred to the reassigned member or archived
- **Process assignments**: Removed from any processes they were assigned to
- **Workflow tasks**: Incomplete tasks are reassigned or marked as unassigned

### Assessments

- **Completed assessments**: Remain in the system for historical records
- **In-progress assessments**: Marked as incomplete and preserved
- **Assessment results**: Maintained for reporting and analytics

### Comments and Activity

- **Comments**: Remain visible but attributed to "Former Team Member"
- **Activity logs**: Preserved for audit trail purposes
- **Chat history**: Maintained for context in AI conversations

### Documents and Files

- **Uploaded documents**: Transferred to the reassigned member
- **Shared files**: Access is removed but files remain with other team members

<Info>
Removing a team member does not delete their historical contributions. This ensures your team's data integrity and audit trail remain intact.
</Info>

## Reassigning Ownership

Before removing a member who owns significant content, consider reassigning ownership:

<Accordion title="Identify Content Owners">
Review the member's profile to see what processes, workflows, and documents they own.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Choose Appropriate Reassignment">
Select team members who are familiar with the content or have related responsibilities.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Communicate with New Owners">
Notify team members when you reassign content to them so they are aware of their new responsibilities.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Transfer in Batches">
For members with extensive content, consider reassigning ownership before removing them to make the process smoother.
</Accordion>

## Special Cases

### Removing Team Owners

<Warning>
You cannot remove a Team Owner if they are the last owner. At least one Team Owner must remain on the team at all times. (Our captures show "Braulio" as Owner, and his "Actions" column is disabled).
</Warning>

To remove a Team Owner:

1. Ensure at least one other Team Owner exists
2. Follow the standard removal process
3. Be aware that Owners may have configured critical team settings

### Removing Admins

When removing an Administrator:

- Review any team settings they may have configured
- Check if they set up any integrations or AI configurations
- Ensure other admins are aware of the change

### Removing Members with Active Workflows

If a member has active workflow tasks:

1. Review their current assignments
2. Reassign urgent tasks to other team members
3. Update workflow roles if they were part of approval chains
4. Notify affected team members about the change

## After Removing a Member

After removal, you should:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Verify Access Revocation">
    Confirm the member no longer appears in your team roster and cannot access the platform.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review Reassigned Content">
    Check that content was properly transferred to the designated team members.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Update Team Processes">
    Modify any processes or workflows that specifically referenced the removed member.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Communicate with the Team">
    If appropriate, notify your team about the change, especially if it affects their work.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Update Documentation">
    Revise any team documentation or process guides that mentioned the removed member.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Re-inviting Removed Members

If you need to add a removed member back to your team:

1. Send a new invitation using their email address
2. They will need to accept the invitation like a new member
3. Their previous content and history will not automatically restore
4. You can manually reassign any archived content back to them if needed

<Tip>
If someone temporarily leaves your team but might return, consider changing their role to a limited "Member" role instead of removing them completely. This preserves their access history.
</Tip>

## Data Retention and Privacy

### What Is Deleted

- The member's active session and access tokens
- Their membership record in your team
- Their personal preferences for your team

### What Is Retained

- Historical activity logs (for audit purposes)
- Completed assessments and results
- Comments and contributions (attributed to "Former Team Member")
- Any content that was reassigned

<Note>
Removed members can still access their own personal account if they are members of other teams. Removal only affects their access to your specific team.
</Note>
