title: "Managing Features"
description: "Enable, disable, and configure features for your team"
---

<Note>
This feature is available to **Team Admins** and **Team Owners** only.
</Note>

## Overview

Feature management allows you to control which capabilities are available to your team. You can enable features as your team grows and is ready to adopt new capabilities, or disable features that do not align with your workflow.

## Understanding Feature Flags

Feature flags are toggles that enable or disable specific functionality:

- **Why use feature flags?** They let you customize the platform to match your team's needs
- **When to enable features?** When your team is ready to adopt new capabilities
- **When to disable features?** To simplify the interface or prevent misuse
- **Impact**: Disabled features are hidden from all team members

<Tip>
Start with essential features enabled and gradually adopt advanced capabilities as your team becomes comfortable with the platform.
</Tip>
