## Overview

Inviting team members allows you to grow your team and delegate responsibilities. When you invite someone, they receive an email with instructions to join your team and access the Business Process Framework.

## How to Invite Team Members

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Team Settings">
    Click on your team name in the top navigation bar, then select **Team Settings** from the dropdown menu.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Access the Members Section">
    In the left sidebar, click on **Members** to view your current team roster.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click Invite Member">
    Click the **Invite Member** button in the top right corner of the Members page.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter Email Address">
    Type the email address of the person you want to invite. Ensure the email address is correct, as the invitation will be sent to this address.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Initial Role">
    Choose the role you want to assign to the new member:
    - **Team Owner**: Full administrative access
    - **Team Admin**: Can manage team settings and members
    - **Team Member**: Standard access to team features
    - **Guest**: Limited access to specific processes
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Personal Message (Optional)">
    You can include a personal message that will be included in the invitation email. This is helpful for providing context about why they are being invited.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Send Invitation">
    Click **Send Invitation** to send the email. The invitee will appear in your **Pending Invitations** list.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Email Invitations

When you send an invitation, the recipient receives an email containing:

- Your team name and who sent the invitation
- A secure invitation link (valid for 7 days)
- The role they have been assigned
- Any personal message you included
- Instructions for accepting the invitation

<Tip>
Invitation links expire after 7 days for security reasons. If an invitation expires, you will need to resend it.
</Tip>

## Setting Initial Roles

When inviting a new member, you must assign them an initial role. Consider the following:

- **Start conservative**: You can always promote members later, but demoting can be awkward
- **Match responsibilities**: Assign roles that align with their actual job responsibilities
- **Consider trust level**: Owner and Admin roles have significant permissions
- **Review role permissions**: Understand what each role can do before assigning it

<Note>
You can change a member's role at any time after they accept the invitation. See [Managing Roles](/admin/managing-roles) for more information.
</Note>

## Managing Pending Invitations

### Viewing Pending Invitations

In the Members section, pending invitations are displayed in a separate **Pending Invitations** tab. Here you can see:

- Email address of the invitee
- Role assigned
- Date invitation was sent
- Expiration date
- Current status

### Resending Invitations

If an invitation expires or the recipient did not receive the email:

1. Locate the pending invitation in the **Pending Invitations** tab
2. Click the **Resend** button next to the invitation
3. A new invitation email will be sent with a fresh 7-day expiration

### Canceling Invitations

To cancel a pending invitation:

1. Find the invitation in the **Pending Invitations** tab
2. Click the **Cancel** button (trash icon)
3. Confirm the cancellation

The invitation link will be immediately invalidated, and the invitee will no longer be able to join using that link.

## Best Practices

## Troubleshooting

### Invitee Did Not Receive Email

If a team member says they did not receive the invitation email:

1. Ask them to check their spam/junk folder
2. Verify you entered the correct email address
3. Resend the invitation
4. If the issue persists, have them add `noreply@yourdomain.com` to their email contacts

### Cannot Send Invitation

If you are unable to send an invitation:

- Verify you have Admin or Owner permissions
- Check if your team has reached its member limit
- Ensure the email address is not already a team member
- Confirm the email address is not associated with a pending invitation

If you continue to experience issues with invitations, contact your system administrator or support team.
