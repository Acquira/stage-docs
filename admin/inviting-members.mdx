## Overview

Inviting team members allows you to grow your team and delegate responsibilities. When you invite someone, they receive an email with instructions to join your team and access **Stage3**.

## How to Invite Team Members

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Team Settings">
    In the main navigation sidebar, click on **Administration**, then select **Team Settings**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Access the Members Section">
    The **Team Settings** page will load, showing the "Team Members" section by default.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click Invite Member">
    Click the **+ Invite Member** button, located above the "Team Members" list on the right.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter Email Address">
    In the "Invite Team Member" modal, type the email address of the person you want to invite. Ensure the email address is correct.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Initial Role">
    Choose the role you want to assign to the new member from the dropdown:
    - **Administrator**: Full permissions to manage settings and members.
    - **Member**: Standard permissions to create and manage processes.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Send Invitation">
    Click the **Send Invitation** button (icon) to send the email. The invitee will appear in your "Pending Invitations" list.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Email Invitations

When you send an invitation, the recipient receives an email containing:

- Your team name and who sent the invitation
- A secure invitation link (valid for 7 days)
- The role they have been assigned
- Instructions for accepting the invitation

<Tip>
Invitation links expire after 7 days for security reasons. If an invitation expires, you will need to resend it.
</Tip>

## Setting Initial Roles

When inviting a new member, you must assign them an initial role. The roles available are:

- **Administrator**: Can manage team settings, billing, and invite other members.
- **Member**: Standard access to create processes and workflows. They cannot access the **Administration** panel.
- **Owner**: This role is typically assigned to the team creator and cannot be assigned directly via invitation.

<Note>
You can change a member's role at any time after they accept the invitation. See [Managing Roles](/admin/managing-roles) for more information.
</Note>

## Managing Pending Invitations

### Viewing Pending Invitations

In **Team Settings**, you can see the number of "Pending Invitations" in the metrics at the top. A separate list or tab shows:

- Email address of the invitee
- Role assigned
- Date invitation was sent
- Expiration date
- Current status

### Resending Invitations

If an invitation expires or the recipient did not receive the email:

1. Locate the pending invitation in the **Pending Invitations** list
2. Click the **Resend** button next to the invitation
3. A new invitation email will be sent with a fresh 7-day expiration

### Canceling Invitations

To cancel a pending invitation:

1. Find the invitation in the **Pending Invitations** list
2. Click the **Cancel** button (trash icon)
3. Confirm the cancellation

The invitation link will be immediately invalidated, and the invitee will no longer be able to join using that link.

## Best Practices

## Troubleshooting

### Invitee Did Not Receive Email

If a team member says they did not receive the invitation email:

1. Ask them to check their spam/junk folder
2. Verify you entered the correct email address
3. Resend the invitation
4. If the issue persists, have them add `noreply@acquira.com` (or your organization's domain) to their email contacts

### Cannot Send Invitation

If you are unable to send an invitation:

- Verify you have Admin or Owner permissions
- Check if your team has reached its member limit
- Ensure the email address is not already a team member
- Confirm the email address is not associated with a pending invitation
