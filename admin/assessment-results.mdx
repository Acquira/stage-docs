## Understanding Your Overall Score

### Score Calculation

Your overall score is calculated as:

- **Display**: Shown as both a percentage and a letter grade

### Score Interpretation

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Excellent (85-100%)" icon="trophy">
    **A Grade**

    Your organization demonstrates strong performance in this area. Practices align well with industry best practices. Focus on maintaining excellence and fine-tuning specific aspects.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Good (70-84%)" icon="thumbs-up">
    **B Grade**

    Your organization performs well with some room for improvement. Most core practices are in place. Focus on strengthening specific weak areas identified in category breakdowns.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Fair (55-69%)" icon="scale-balanced">
    **C Grade**

    Your organization has foundational practices but significant gaps exist. Many areas need attention. Prioritize high-impact improvements identified in recommendations.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Needs Improvement (40-54%)" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    **D Grade**

    Your organization faces substantial challenges in this area. Basic practices may be missing or inconsistently applied. Immediate attention and systematic improvement are needed.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Critical (0-39%)" icon="circle-exclamation">
    **F Grade**

    Your organization has critical deficiencies in this area. Fundamental practices are largely absent. This area should be a top priority for immediate intervention and improvement.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Info>
Scores are relative to industry best practices, not perfection. Even well-run organizations typically score in the 70-85% range, as there is always room for improvement.
</Info>

## Category Breakdown

Each assessment is divided into multiple categories that represent different aspects of the evaluated domain.

### Understanding Categories

**Example: Operations & Processes Assessment**

The assessment is divided into categories such as:

- **Process Documentation** (20% of total score)
- **Workflow Efficiency** (25% of total score)
- **Quality Control** (20% of total score)
- **Continuous Improvement** (20% of total score)
- **Technology & Automation** (15% of total score)

### Category Scores

For each category, you receive:

- **Category Score**: 0-100% for that specific category
- **Weight**: How much this category contributes to your overall score
- **Question Count**: Number of questions in this category
- **Strengths**: Specific areas where you scored well
- **Weaknesses**: Specific areas needing improvement

### Category Performance Chart

    - **Yellow bars** (50-69%): Moderate performance
    - **Red bars** (0-49%): Weak performance

    Bars are sorted by score (lowest to highest) to highlight priority areas.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Spider/Radar Chart">
    Visual representation showing balance across categories:
    - Each axis represents one category
    - Filled area shows your performance
    - Ideal shape is a balanced polygon

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Table View">
    Detailed tabular breakdown:
    - Category name and description
    - Score and grade
    - Weight contribution
    - Number of questions
    - Key strengths and weaknesses

    This view is best for detailed analysis and reporting.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
Focus your improvement efforts on categories with the lowest scores that have high weight. These yield the biggest impact on your overall score and business performance.
</Tip>

- **Priority level**: Urgency of addressing this risk

<Warning>
AI-generated insights are based on patterns in your responses and industry best practices. They should inform but not replace human judgment and organizational context.
</Warning>

## Comparing Results Over Time

### Side-by-Side Comparison

Compare two assessment completions:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Assessments to Compare">
    From the History tab, select two different completion dates.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click Compare">
    Click the **Compare** button to generate a comparison view.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review Changes">
    View side-by-side scores showing:
    - Overall score change (+/- percentage points)
    - Category score changes
    - Questions with improved answers
    - Questions with declined answers
  </Step>

  <Step title="Analyze Trends">
    Identify which improvement efforts were successful and which areas still need work.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Key Metrics for Comparison

When comparing assessments, focus on:

- **Score change**: Positive means improvement, negative means decline
- **Category shifts**: Which categories improved or declined most
- **Consistency**: Stable high scores indicate sustained excellence
- **Volatility**: Large swings suggest inconsistent practices

<Tip>
Small score changes (1-3 percentage points) may reflect normal variation. Look for changes of 5+ percentage points as meaningful improvement or decline.
</Tip>
