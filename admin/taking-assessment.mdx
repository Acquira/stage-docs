</Steps>

## Understanding Question Types

Assessments use several question formats:

### Likert Scale Questions

Most common question type, using a 1-5 rating scale:

**Example**: "How well does your organization document its core processes?"

- **1 - Not at all**: We have no process documentation
- **2 - Slightly**: Some processes are documented, but most are not
- **3 - Moderately**: About half of our processes are documented
- **4 - Very well**: Most processes are documented with some gaps
- **5 - Extremely well**: All critical processes are thoroughly documented

<Note>
Choose the option that most accurately reflects your current state. When in doubt, select the more conservative option.
</Note>

### Yes/No Questions

Binary questions about specific practices or capabilities:

**Example**: "Does your organization have a documented strategic plan?"

- **Yes**: We have a written strategic plan
- **No**: We do not have a formal strategic plan

### Multiple Choice Questions

Select one option from several possibilities:

**Example**: "How often does your organization review financial performance?"

- Daily
- Weekly
- Monthly
- Quarterly
- Annually
- Never

### Numeric Input Questions

Provide specific numbers or percentages:

**Example**: "What percentage of your employees have received formal training in the last 12 months?"

- Enter a number between 0 and 100

### Open-Text Questions

Provide detailed responses in your own words:

**Example**: "Describe your organization's approach to risk management."

- Text box for detailed response

<Info>
Open-text responses are analyzed by AI (if enabled) to provide more nuanced recommendations. Provide detailed, specific answers when possible.
</Info>

## Navigating the Assessment

### Progress Tracking

As you complete the assessment:

- **Progress bar**: Shows percentage completed
- **Question counter**: Displays current question number and total (e.g., "Question 15 of 45")
- **Section indicator**: Shows which category you are in
- **Time estimate**: Updates remaining time based on your pace

### Navigation Controls

    Return to the previous question to review or change your answer.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Save & Exit" icon="floppy-disk">

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Required vs. Optional Questions

- **Required questions**: Marked with a red asterisk (*), must be answered to submit
- **Optional questions**: Can be skipped, but completing them improves result accuracy
- **Conditional questions**: Only appear based on previous answers

<Warning>
You cannot submit an assessment with unanswered required questions. The system will highlight any missing required responses when you attempt to submit.
</Warning>

## Conditional Questions

Some assessments include conditional logic where certain questions only appear based on your previous answers.

**Example**:
- **Question 10**: "Does your organization use project management software?"
  - If **Yes**: Questions 11-13 ask about specific features and usage
  - If **No**: Questions 11-13 are skipped, and you proceed to Question 14

<Note>
Question numbers may appear to jump when conditional questions are skipped. This is normal behavior.
</Note>

## Answering Questions Effectively

### Be Honest and Objective

- Answer based on actual practices, not aspirations
- Consider what happens most of the time, not best-case scenarios
- If a practice is inconsistently followed, rate it lower
- Acknowledge gaps and weaknesses honestly

### Use Supporting Evidence

- Reference specific metrics when available
- Consider recent examples or incidents
- Think about documented processes vs. informal practices
- Consult data rather than relying solely on perception

### Consider the Time Frame

- Unless specified otherwise, answer based on current state
- For questions about frequency, consider the last 12 months
- For questions about capabilities, evaluate current capacity
- Note significant recent changes in comment fields

### Add Context with Comments

Many questions include an optional comment field. Use it to:

- Explain unusual circumstances
- Provide specific examples
- Note recent changes or initiatives
- Clarify nuanced situations
- Add context that affects your rating

**Example comment**: "Rated as 3 because we recently implemented new documentation processes. Historical documentation is sparse, but new processes are well-documented."

<Tip>
Comments do not affect your score but provide valuable context for interpreting results and generating recommendations.
</Tip>

## Saving and Resuming
