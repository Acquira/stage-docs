## Overview

User roles determine what team members can do within your organization. As an administrator, you can change roles to match team members' responsibilities and level of trust within your organization.

## Understanding Role Hierarchy

The Business Process Framework has four role levels:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Team Owner" icon="crown">
    **Full Control**

    Complete access to all team features, settings, and administrative functions. Can manage billing, delete the team, and assign/remove other owners.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Team Admin" icon="user-shield">
    **Administrative Access**

    Can manage team members, configure settings, and access all processes. Cannot manage billing or delete the team.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Team Member" icon="user">
    **Standard Access**

    Can create and manage processes, participate in workflows, and view team KPIs. Cannot change team settings or manage members.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Guest" icon="user-clock">
    **Limited Access**

    Can only access specific processes they are assigned to. Cannot view team-wide information or create new processes.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## How to Change User Roles

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Team Members">
    Go to **Team Settings** > **Members** to view your team roster.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Locate the Team Member">
    Find the member whose role you want to change in the members list.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click the Role Dropdown">
    Click on the current role displayed next to the member's name. A dropdown menu will appear with available roles.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select New Role">
    Choose the new role from the dropdown menu.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Confirm the Change">
    A confirmation dialog will appear. Review the role change and click **Confirm** to proceed.
  </Step>
</Steps>

The role change takes effect immediately, and the team member's permissions are updated in real time.

<Warning>
Changing roles affects what a team member can access and do. Notify the member when you change their role so they understand their new permissions.
</Warning>

## Promoting Team Members

When promoting a team member to a higher role, consider:

<Accordion title="Has the member demonstrated responsibility?">
Ensure they have consistently used the platform appropriately and followed team guidelines.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Do they need the elevated permissions?">
Only promote when the role matches their actual job responsibilities. Avoid unnecessary elevated access.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Have you communicated expectations?">
Before promoting someone to Admin or Owner, discuss what you expect from them in their new role.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Do they understand the risks?">
Higher roles have access to sensitive information and can make consequential changes. Ensure they understand the responsibility.
</Accordion>

## Demoting Team Members

Demoting a team member should be handled carefully:

<Warning>
Demoting a team member may affect their ability to complete their work. Ensure you have discussed this change with them or have a valid reason for the change.
</Warning>

Before demoting:

1. **Review their current responsibilities**: Ensure they do not need their current permissions for their work
2. **Communicate the change**: If appropriate, let them know their role is changing and why
3. **Transfer ownership**: If they own processes or data, reassign ownership before demoting
4. **Verify access needs**: Confirm they will still have access to what they need in their new role

## Role Change Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Follow the Principle of Least Privilege" icon="lock">
    Give team members the minimum level of access they need to do their work effectively.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Document Role Decisions" icon="file-lines">
    Keep track of why you assigned specific roles to team members, especially for administrative positions.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Review Roles Regularly" icon="rotate">
    Periodically audit team member roles to ensure they still match current responsibilities.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Communicate Changes" icon="bullhorn">
    Always notify team members when their role changes, even for promotions.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Have Multiple Owners" icon="users">
    Ensure at least two team members have Owner access to prevent lockout situations.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Train New Admins" icon="graduation-cap">

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Special Considerations

### Owner Role Changes

<Warning>
Be extremely careful when assigning or removing Owner roles. Owners can delete the team, manage billing, and make irreversible changes.
</Warning>

- Only Team Owners can assign or remove Owner roles
- You cannot remove the Owner role from yourself if you are the last Owner
- Consider having 2-3 Owners for redundancy

### Bulk Role Changes

If you need to change roles for multiple team members:

1. Plan the changes in advance
2. Communicate with affected members
3. Make changes during off-peak hours if possible
4. Verify each change after completion

<Tip>
If you need to change many roles at once, consider whether your team structure or processes need adjustment.
