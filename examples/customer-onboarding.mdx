## Blueprint: Handling Implementation Delays

When onboarding falls behind schedule:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Identify Root Cause">
    Common causes:
    - Customer resource constraints
    - Technical integration challenges
    - Change management resistance
    - Scope creep
    - Competing priorities
  </Step>

  <Step title="Assess Impact">
    Determine:
    - How many days behind schedule?
    - What activities are blocked?
    - Does go-live date need to change?
    - Is customer satisfaction at risk?
  </Step>

  <Step title="Develop Recovery Plan">
    Options:
    - **Compress timeline:** Combine activities, run things in parallel
    - **Reduce scope:** Launch with MVP, add features later
    - **Add resources:** Bring in additional support
    - **Extend timeline:** Reset expectations and communicate new dates
  </Step>

  <Step title="Communicate Proactively">
    - Schedule call with customer admin and executive sponsor
    - Present situation honestly
    - Propose recovery plan with clear rationale
    - Get agreement on path forward
    - Document new timeline
  </Step>

  <Step title="Execute and Monitor">
    - Update project plan
    - Increase check-in frequency
    - Remove roadblocks aggressively
    - Celebrate small wins to maintain momentum
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Most delays are due to customer resource constraints. Build buffer time into your initial plan and set clear expectations about time commitment required from the customer.
</Tip>
