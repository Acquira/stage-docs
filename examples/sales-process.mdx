## Blueprint: Handling Price Objections

When a prospect objects to pricing, follow this framework:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Acknowledge and Clarify">
    "I understand pricing is an important consideration. Help me understandâ€”is it the total investment, or the pricing structure that concerns you?"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Revisit Value">
    Refer back to the ROI analysis and pain points discussed earlier. "Based on our analysis, you're currently losing $X per month to [problem]. Our solution pays for itself in Y months."
  </Step>

  <Step title="Explore Options">
    - Offer annual vs monthly pricing
    - Suggest starting with fewer users/features
    - Discuss phased implementation
    - Review financing options if available
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create Urgency">
    "We have a quarter-end promotion that expires Friday" or "The current pricing is locked for contracts signed this month."
  </Step>

  <Step title="Know When to Walk Away">
    If the prospect doesn't have budget or won't get budget approval, it's better to disqualify than waste time on a deal that won't close.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
Never discount more than 15% without VP Sales approval. Excessive discounting devalues your product and sets bad precedent for renewals.
</Note>
