## Blueprint: Handling Offer Declines

When a candidate declines your offer:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Request Feedback">
    "We're disappointed but understand. Would you be willing to share what drove your decision? Your feedback helps us improve."

    Common reasons:
    - Chose competing offer (compensation, title, growth)
    - Accepted counter-offer from current employer
    - Personal/family reasons
    - Concerns about role, company, or team
  </Step>

  <Step title="Keep Door Open">
    "We were impressed by you and would love to stay in touch. Things may change in the future for both of us."

    - Add to talent pool for future opportunities
    - Connect on LinkedIn
    - Send occasional company updates
  </Step>

  <Step title="Evaluate Backup Candidate">
    If you have a strong backup from interviews:
    - Were they a close second?
    - Are they still available/interested?
    - Can you move quickly (within 3-5 days)?

    If yes, proceed with offer
    If no, resume sourcing
  </Step>

  <Step title="Analyze Trends">
    If you have multiple declines:
    - Is compensation competitive?
    - Is interview process too long/difficult?
    - Are you overselling or misrepresenting role?
    - Is employer brand an issue?

    Make data-driven improvements
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
Never guilt-trip or burn bridges with candidates who decline. They may refer others, reapply later, or become customers. Always handle declines gracefully.
</Warning>
