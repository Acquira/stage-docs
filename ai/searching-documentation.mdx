---

The AI assistant can search through all your documentation instantly, finding information across blueprints, guides, SOPs, and knowledge base documents. No more hunting through folders or scrolling through long documents.

## What the AI Can Search

The AI has access to:

- Process blueprints
- Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)
- User guides and manuals
- Knowledge base documents (uploaded by admins)
- Activity documentation
- Best practice guides

<Info>
The AI searches all these sources simultaneously and can provide information from multiple documents in a single response.
</Info>

## Simple Search Queries

Just ask for what you need in plain language:

"Find information about password reset procedures"

"What do our documents say about handling customer complaints?"

"Show me guidelines for social media posting"

"Where can I find the vacation request policy?"


## Getting Specific Information

The more specific your question, the more targeted the answer:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Broad Search" icon="magnifying-glass">
    "What's our policy on expenses?"

    Returns: General expense information
  </Card>

  <Card title="Specific Search" icon="bullseye">
    "What's the maximum daily meal allowance for domestic travel?"

    Returns: Exact policy detail
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Cross-Referencing Documentation

The AI can connect information from multiple sources:

You: "What's the complete process for handling a product return?"

AI: "Let me pull together information from several sources:

From the Customer Service SOP:

Initial return request should be logged in the system within 24 hours

Customer service validates the return eligibility

From the Returns Process Blueprint:

Approved returns get a Return Authorization (RA) number

Shipping label is generated automatically

From the Warehouse Operations Guide:

Returned items are inspected within 48 hours of receipt

Inspection results determine refund amount

From the Finance Policy:

Refunds are processed within 5 business days of inspection approval

Would you like details on any specific step?"


<Tip>
The AI remembers context. You can ask "Tell me more about the inspection process" and it will know you're referring to the return inspection mentioned above.
</Tip>

## Finding Policy Information

Ask about policies and guidelines:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Time Off Policies">
    **You:** "How many vacation days do employees get?"

    **AI:** "According to the Employee Handbook (Section 4.2):
    - 0-2 years: 10 days per year
    - 2-5 years: 15 days per year
    - 5+ years: 20 days per year

    Vacation days accrue monthly and can be carried over up to 5 days per year."
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Approval Thresholds">
    **You:** "What's the approval threshold for hiring new staff?"

    **AI:** "From the Hiring Process SOP:

    Department managers can approve:
    - Replacement hires (budgeted positions)

    Director approval required for:
    - New positions up to $75K salary

    Executive team approval required for:
    - New positions over $75K salary
    - Any position requiring budget increase"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Compliance Requirements">
    **You:** "What are the data security requirements for customer information?"

    **AI:** "Based on the Data Security Policy and Customer Data Handling Guide:

    Required protections:
    - All customer data must be encrypted at rest and in transit
    - Access limited to role-based permissions only
    - Regular security audits quarterly

    Prohibited actions:
    - Storing customer data on personal devices
    - Sharing credentials
    - Downloading customer lists without approval"
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Finding Procedures and Steps

Get step-by-step instructions from documentation:

You: "How do I submit a purchase request?"

AI: "From the Procurement SOP, here's the purchase request process:

Step 1: Gather Requirements

Itemize what you need

Get 3 quotes (for purchases over $1,000)

Confirm budget availability with your manager

Step 2: Submit Request

Log into the procurement system

Complete the PR form (Form PR-100)

Attach quotes and justification

Step 3: Approval Routing

Under $5,000: Manager approval only

$5,000-$25,000: Manager + Director approval

Over $25,000: Manager + Director + Finance approval

Step 4: Wait for Approval

You'll receive email notifications at each approval stage

Average approval time: 3-5 business days

Would you like details on any specific step?"


## Discovering Related Information

The AI can suggest related documentation you might not have thought of:

You: "Tell me about onboarding new employees"

AI: "I found several relevant documents about employee onboarding:

Primary Resources:

New Employee Onboarding Process (main blueprint)

IT Setup Guide for New Hires

First Week Checklist

Related Resources:

Manager's Guide to Onboarding

Remote Employee Setup Procedures

Onboarding Success Metrics

Which area would you like to explore first?"


<Tip>
If the AI suggests multiple documents, ask it to summarize each one so you can decide which is most relevant to your needs.
</Tip>

## Comparing Information

Ask the AI to compare information from different sources:

You: "What's the difference between the contractor agreement process and the vendor agreement process?"

AI: "Here's a comparison based on the Legal Processes Guide:

Contractor Agreements:

Used for: Individual service providers

Typical duration: Project-based or up to 1 year

Approval: Hiring manager + Legal review

Key terms: Work scope, deliverables, payment schedule

Vendor Agreements:

Used for: Companies providing goods/services

Typical duration: 1-3 years with renewal options

Approval: Department head + Legal + Procurement

Key terms: Service levels, pricing, liability, termination

Both require: Background checks, insurance verification, and compliance with company policies."


## Finding Examples and Templates

Look for templates, examples, and best practices:

- "Show me an example of a project charter"
- "What's the template for quarterly reports?"
- "Are there examples of good customer follow-up emails?"
- "What's the recommended format for meeting notes?"

## Source Attribution

The AI tells you where information comes from:

<Note>
When the AI provides information, it includes the source document name. This helps you:
- Verify the information
- Find the full document if needed
- Know how current the information is
- Understand the context
</Note>

Example:
AI: "According to the Remote Work Policy (updated March 2024), employees can work remotely up to 3 days per week..."


## When Documents Conflict

If the AI finds conflicting information, it will tell you:

You: "What's the expense report deadline?"

AI: "I found two different timelines in the documentation:

Expense Policy (updated Jan 2024):

Submit within 30 days of expense

Manager Handbook (updated June 2023):

Submit within 60 days of expense

The Expense Policy is more recent and likely the current standard. I recommend confirming with Finance or your manager."


## Knowledge Base Documents

If your admin has uploaded documents to the knowledge base, the AI can search those too:

You: "What does our industry research say about customer retention?"

AI: "From the Q4 2024 Industry Research Report in the knowledge base:

Key findings on customer retention:

Industry average retention rate: 68%

Top performers achieve 85%+ retention

Main retention drivers: Customer service quality (40%), Product reliability (30%), Pricing (20%), Other (10%)

The report recommends focusing on customer service training as the highest-impact retention strategy."


<Info>
Knowledge base documents are uploaded and managed by system administrators. If you can't find something, ask your admin if the document has been added to the knowledge base of **Stage3**.
