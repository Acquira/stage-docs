This is an **administrator-only feature**. Only users with admin privileges can create and manage master prompts.

## Master Prompts Explained Simply

Think of a master prompt as instructions you give the AI about how to behave and what to focus on. It's like giving guidelines to a new team member about how your organization works and what matters most.

<Info>
A master prompt doesn't change what the AI knows. Instead, it shapes how the AI uses that knowledge and how it communicates with your team.
</Info>

## What Master Prompts Do

Master prompts tell the AI:

- **Tone and style** - How formal or casual to be
- **Priorities** - What information to emphasize
- **Approach** - How to structure answers
- **Awareness** - Special considerations for your organization
- **Boundaries** - What to avoid or handle carefully

### Example Without Master Prompt

User: "How do I submit an expense report?"

AI: "To submit an expense report, follow these steps:

Gather your receipts

Complete the expense form

Submit for approval

Wait for processing"


### Example With Custom Master Prompt

User: "How do I submit an expense report?"

AI: "I'll help you submit your expense report through our Concur system. Here's what you need:

Log into Concur (link in your email from IT)

Click 'New Report' and select your department

Upload receipts (required for anything over $25)

Your manager Sarah will get it for approval

Finance processes reports every Friday

Need help with Concur? The Finance team has drop-in hours Tuesdays 2-4pm.

Tip: Submit by Thursday to get reimbursed the same week!"


The master prompt added:
- Specific system name (Concur)
- Manager's name
- Dollar threshold detail
- Processing schedule
- Helpful resources
- Practical tip

## What Master Prompts Are NOT

<Warning>
**Master prompts are not:**

- A way to add new information (use **AI Master Prompts** to upload documents for that)
- A replacement for documentation
- Guaranteed to change every AI response
- A way to restrict AI capabilities
- Permanent and unchangeable (you can update them anytime)
</Warning>

Master prompts guide behavior, they don't replace content.

## Single vs. Multiple Master Prompts

You can create different master prompts for different purposes:

### Global Master Prompt
One prompt that applies to all AI conversations
- Best for general organizational guidance
- Sets overall tone and priorities
- Simplest to manage

### Context-Specific Prompts
Different prompts for different situations
- Different prompts for different departments
- Specialized prompts for specific processes
- More complex but more tailored

<Tip>
Start with one global master prompt. Add specialized prompts only when you have specific needs that differ significantly from the general approach.
</Tip>

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Professional Services Firm

Master prompt emphasis:

Client confidentiality always

Reference timekeeping system (ClickTime)

Include billing implications when relevant

Professional, formal tone

Mention project codes for expense tracking


Result: AI naturally includes these elements in responses about projects, time tracking, and expenses.

### Example 2: Remote-First Tech Company

Master prompt emphasis:

Assume remote work context

Reference async communication preferences

Time zone awareness in scheduling

Tools: Slack, Zoom, Notion, GitHub

Emphasize documentation and written communication


Result: AI provides remote-friendly guidance and references the right tools.

### Example 3: Customer Service Organization

Master prompt emphasis:

Customer satisfaction is top priority

Reference SLA requirements

Include escalation paths

Empathetic, helpful tone

Mention available support hours


Result: AI focuses on customer impact and service standards.

## How Master Prompts Work Technically

When a user asks a question:

1. The AI receives the user's question
2. The master prompt is automatically included as context
3. The AI considers both the question and the master prompt guidance
4. The AI responds following the master prompt guidelines

<Info>
Users don't see the master prompt. It works behind the scenes to shape responses.
</Info>

## Testing and Refining

Master prompts can be updated based on how well they work:

1. **Create** an initial master prompt
2. **Test** with common questions
3. **Observe** how responses change
4. **Refine** the prompt to improve results
5. **Update** as your organization evolves

<Tip>
Ask team members to try the AI after you create a master prompt. Their feedback will help you refine it.
</Tip>

## Benefits of Good Master Prompts

Well-crafted master prompts lead to:

- More relevant answers that match your organization
- Faster user understanding (less explaining context)
- Consistent communication style
- Better integration with your tools and systems
- Increased user confidence in AI responses
