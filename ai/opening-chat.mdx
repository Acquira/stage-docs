The AI assistant is always ready to help you with your work. You can access it via the floating chat button or the main sidebar.

## Method 1: The Floating Chat Button (Recommended)

This is the quickest way to access the AI assistant from anywhere in the application.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find the chat button">
    Look for the blue chat icon button in the **bottom-right corner** of your screen. It's always there, on every page of the application.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click the chat button">
    Click the floating chat button. The chat window will pop open from the bottom-right corner.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Method 2: The AI Chat Page

You can also access a full-page version of the AI assistant.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find 'AI Chat' in the Sidebar">
    Look for the **"AI Chat"** option in the main platform sidebar on the left side of your screen.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open the Chat Page">
    Click on **"AI Chat"**. This will open the full-page "AI Chat Assistant" interface.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Use the **floating button** for quick questions while you work. Use the **full page** for longer, more in-depth conversations.
</Tip>

## Navigating the Chat Window

The chat window (both the pop-up and the full page) is simple and powerful.

* **Input Box:** Type your question in the "Ask a question..." box at the bottom.
* **[Chat] Tab:** This is the main conversation tab for general questions.
* **[Context] Tab:** This powerful feature lets you add your specific processes, blueprints, and activities to the chat so the AI can give you answers based on your team's work.
* **History Icon (`<icon-clocks>`):** Click this to see "Recent Sessions" and start a new session.
* **New Chat Icon (`+`):** Click this to start a new, blank chat.

<Info>
**Context selection is only available on Core pages.** You may need to navigate to a specific Core Process page to select its blueprints and activities as context.
</Info>

## Switching Between Sessions

You can easily switch between different conversations.

<Steps>
  <Step title="View your sessions">
    Click the **History icon (clock)** at the top of the chat window to see all your "Recent Sessions".
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select a session">
    Click on any previous conversation to continue where you left off.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start a New Session">
    Click **"+ Start New Session"** from the History panel to begin a new topic.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Closing the Chat Pop-up

When you're done with the pop-up chat:

* Click the **X button** in the corner of the window.
