<Note>
This is an **administrator-only feature**. Only users with admin privileges can create and manage master prompts.
</Note>

Master prompts help you customize how the AI assistant behaves and communicates with your team. This guide shows you how to create effective prompts.

## Before You Start

Have ready:

- Understanding of your organization's communication style
- List of systems and tools your team uses
- Key priorities or values to emphasize
- Any special terminology or industry context
- Examples of questions users commonly ask

<Tip>
Don't worry about making it perfect the first time. You can test, refine, and update master prompts as often as needed.

</Steps>

## What to Include in Your Prompt

A good master prompt typically includes:

### 1. Communication Style

Tell the AI how to communicate:

```
Examples:

"Use a friendly, conversational tone. Avoid overly formal language."

"Maintain a professional tone suitable for a corporate environment."

"Be concise and direct. Busy executives prefer brief, actionable answers."

"Be encouraging and supportive, especially for training topics."
```

### 2. Organizational Context

Provide background about your organization:

```
Examples:

"We are a healthcare provider. Patient privacy and HIPAA compliance
are critical considerations in all processes."

"We're a fast-growing startup. Emphasize flexibility and adaptability.
Processes may change frequently."

"We operate globally across 15 countries. Be mindful of time zones
and international considerations."
```

### 3. System and Tool References

List the tools your team uses:

```
Examples:

"When discussing CRM, reference Salesforce specifically."

"For time tracking, mention that we use ClickTime."

"Project management questions should reference Asana."

"Always include links to tool login pages when mentioning systems."
```

### 4. Key Priorities

Highlight what matters most:

```
Examples:

"Safety is our top priority. Always mention safety considerations
first, followed by operational steps."

"Customer satisfaction drives all decisions. Frame answers in terms
of customer impact."

"Efficiency and speed are valued. Suggest the quickest compliant
approach first."
```

### 5. Special Considerations

Note unique aspects of your organization:

```
Examples:

"We have a fully remote team. Don't assume people are in the office."

"Our fiscal year runs July-June, not calendar year."

"We use 'clients' not 'customers' in all communications."

"Include accessibility considerations in process recommendations."
```

## Prompt Writing Tips

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Be Specific" icon="bullseye">
    Instead of: "Be helpful"

    Write: "When users ask about processes, include specific system names, approval workflows, and typical timelines"
  </Card>

  <Card title="Use Examples" icon="list">
    Instead of: "Reference our tools"

    Write: "For CRM questions, say 'in Salesforce' rather than 'in the CRM system'"
  </Card>

  <Card title="Prioritize Clearly" icon="arrow-down-1-9">
    Instead of: "Mention safety and efficiency"

    Write: "Always mention safety first, then efficiency. Safety is never compromised for speed."
  </Card>

  <Card title="Include Context" icon="circle-info">
    Instead of: "We're remote"

    Write: "We're fully remote with team members across US, Europe, and Asia. Assume async communication and note time zones for meetings."
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Testing Your Prompt

Always test before activating:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Use the test panel">
    The prompt editor includes a test interface. Ask typical questions to see responses.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Try diverse questions">
    Test different types of questions:
    - Process questions
    - Team questions
    - Tool/system questions
    - Policy questions
  </Step>

  <Step title="Check for consistency">
    Verify the AI follows your guidance consistently across different topics.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Refine as needed">
    Adjust the prompt based on test results. It may take a few iterations.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Save test questions that represent common user needs. Reuse them each time you update the prompt to ensure consistency.
</Tip>

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

<Warning>
**Don't:**

- Write novels - Keep prompts concise (500-1000 words max)
- Include detailed processes - Put those in documentation
- Over-constrain the AI - Give guidance, not rigid rules
- Forget to test - Always verify before activating
- Set and forget - Review and update regularly
</Warning>

## Updating Master Prompts

Your organization evolves, and your prompt should too:

**Review quarterly:**
- Are referenced systems still current?
- Has company culture or priorities shifted?
- Are there new tools to mention?
- Do test responses still match expectations?

**Update when:**
- You implement new systems
- Company priorities change
- You get feedback about AI responses
- Organizational structure changes

<Info>
You can update master prompts anytime. Changes take effect immediately for new conversations.
</Info>

## Multiple Prompts Strategy

For larger organizations, consider multiple prompts:

### Recommended Approach

1. **Start with one global prompt** covering organization-wide guidance
2. **Add department-specific prompts** only when needed:
   - Sales team prompt (emphasizes CRM, pipeline)
   - Finance team prompt (emphasizes compliance, accuracy)
   - HR team prompt (emphasizes confidentiality, employee care)

### Managing Multiple Prompts

- Use clear naming conventions
- Document what each prompt is for
- Assign prompts to specific contexts
- Test how they interact

<Note>
Most organizations do fine with a single, well-crafted global prompt. Only add complexity when you have clear, specific needs.
</Note>

## Prompt Templates

Start with these templates and customize:

### Basic Template

```
[YOUR ORGANIZATION NAME] AI Assistant Guidelines

Communication Style:
- [Tone: professional/casual/friendly/technical]
- [Format: concise/detailed/visual/step-by-step]

Organizational Context:
- We are a [type of organization]
- Our key focus is [main business/mission]
- We value [core values]

Systems and Tools:
- [System type]: [Specific tool name]
- [System type]: [Specific tool name]

Key Priorities:
- [Priority 1]
- [Priority 2]
- [Priority 3]

Special Considerations:
- [Unique aspect 1]
- [Unique aspect 2]
```

## Getting Feedback

After activating your prompt:

1. **Ask users** how AI responses feel (too formal? too casual? helpful?)
2. **Monitor questions** to see if the AI is guiding effectively
3. **Review example conversations** to spot issues
4. **Iterate based on feedback**

<Tip>
Create a feedback channel (Slack, email, survey) where users can report when AI responses miss the mark. Use this to refine your prompt.
</Tip>
