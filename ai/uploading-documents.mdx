This is an **administrator-only feature**. Only users with admin privileges can upload and manage documents for the AI.
</Note>

## What is the AI Master Prompts Feature?

The **AI Master Prompts** section acts as a central repository for documents that the AI assistant can search and reference when helping users. Think of it as the AI's reference library.

When you upload documents here, the AI can:

- Search their contents
- Answer questions based on the information
- Quote specific sections
- Cross-reference multiple documents
- Provide source citations

## Why Upload Documents?

Upload documents to the AI Master Prompts when you want the AI to help users with:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Company Policies" icon="file-contract">
    Employee handbooks, HR policies, code of conduct, benefits information
  </Card>

  <Card title="Industry Research" icon="chart-line">
    Market research, industry reports, competitive analysis, trend studies
  </Card>

  <Card title="Technical Documentation" icon="book">
    System manuals, technical specifications, integration guides, API documentation
  </Card>

  <Card title="Best Practices" icon="lightbulb">
    Training materials, methodology guides, standard templates, case studies
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Supported File Formats

You can upload documents in these formats:

- **PDF** (.pdf) - Ideal for formatted documents, reports, manuals
- **Word Documents** (.doc, .docx) - Company documents, policies, guides
- **Text Files** (.txt) - Plain text documentation, notes
- **Markdown** (.md) - Technical documentation, formatted guides

<Tip>
PDFs work best for documents with consistent formatting. Word documents are great for content that may be updated frequently.
</Tip>

## How to Upload Documents

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to AI Master Prompts">
    From the main sidebar, navigate to **Administration > AI Master Prompts**.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create a Master Prompt (if needed)">
    If you don't already have a prompt to add documents to, click **"+ Create Prompt"** and give it a clear `Name` and `Description` (e.g., "HR Policies").
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click 'Upload Document'">
    Inside the Master Prompt you want to add to, click the **Upload Document** button (this may be inside the prompt's edit screen).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select your file">
    Click to browse or drag and drop your file into the upload area.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add document details">
    Provide information about the document:
    - **Title**: A clear, descriptive name
    - **Description**: What the document contains (optional but helpful)
    - **Category**: Document type (Policy, Guide, Research, etc.)
    - **Tags**: Keywords to help organize (optional)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enable for AI">
    Check the **"Available to AI"** box to make this document searchable by the AI assistant.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Upload">
    Click **Upload** to process the document. Processing may take a few moments depending on file size.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Document Processing

After upload, the system processes the document:

1. **Text Extraction** - Extracts text content from the file
2. **Indexing** - Organizes content for efficient searching
3. **Validation** - Checks that the content is readable
4. **Status Update** - Shows as "Active" when ready

<Info>
Large documents (over 100 pages) may take a few minutes to process. You'll see a progress indicator during processing.
</Info>

## Best Practices for Uploads

### Choose Clear Titles

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Good Title" icon="circle-check">
    "Employee Remote Work Policy 2024"

    Specific and descriptive
  </Card>

  <Card title="Unclear Title" icon="circle-xmark">
    "Policy_final_v2_updated.pdf"

    Technical and vague
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Add Helpful Descriptions

Good descriptions help you and other admins understand what's in the AI's context:

Good Description: "Company policy on remote work eligibility, equipment provision, and expectations for remote employees. Updated January 2024 to include new hybrid work options."

Minimal Description: "Remote work policy"


### Organize with Categories

Use consistent categories to keep your documents organized:

- Policies & Procedures
- Training & Education
- Industry Research
- Technical Documentation
- Templates & Tools
- Compliance & Legal

### Use Meaningful Tags

Tags help filter and find documents later:

- Document topic: "hiring", "expenses", "security"
- Department: "HR", "Finance", "IT"
- Type: "policy", "guide", "template"
- Date: "2024", "Q1-2024"

## Document Quality Tips

For best AI performance, upload documents that are:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Well-Structured">
    Documents with clear headings, sections, and organization work best. The AI can more easily find and reference specific information.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Text-Based">
    Ensure PDFs contain actual text, not just scanned images. If you have scanned documents, use OCR (Optical Character Recognition) first.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Current and Accurate">
    Only upload current versions of documents. Remove or disable outdated versions to prevent confusion.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Complete">
    Upload complete documents rather than excerpts. The AI needs full context to provide accurate answers.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## What Happens After Upload

Once uploaded and processed:

1. **AI Access** - The AI can immediately search the document content
2. **User Queries** - Users can ask questions, and the AI will reference the document
3. **Source Citations** - When the AI uses information from the document, it cites the source
4. **Search Integration** - The document appears in searches

<Tip>
After uploading an important document, test it by asking the AI a question that should be answered by that document. This confirms it's working correctly.
</Tip>

## File Size Limits

- Maximum file size: **25 MB per document**
- Maximum pages (PDF): **500 pages**
- Total storage size: **1 GB** (per organization)

<Note>
If you need to upload larger documents, consider splitting them into logical sections (e.g., different chapters or topics).
</Note>

## Security Considerations

Documents uploaded to **AI Master Prompts**:

- Are only accessible to users in your organization
- Require authentication to access
- Can be disabled or removed at any time
- Are subject to the same security measures as your other data

<Warning>
Only upload documents that are appropriate for all users in your organization to access via the AI. If a document contains sensitive information limited to specific people, use access controls instead of uploading it.
</Warning>

## Common Upload Issues

### "File Type Not Supported"
- **Cause**: File format not in supported list
- **Solution**: Convert to PDF, Word, or text format

### "File Too Large"
- **Cause**: File exceeds 25 MB limit
- **Solution**: Compress PDF, remove images, or split into multiple documents

### "Processing Failed"
- **Cause**: Corrupted file or password-protected PDF
- **Solution**: Verify file opens correctly, remove password protection

### "No Text Extracted"
- **Cause**: PDF is scanned images without OCR
- **Solution**: Run OCR on the document before uploading
