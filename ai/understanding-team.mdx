The AI assistant knows your team structure, roles, and responsibilities. It's like having an always-updated organizational chart combined with a knowledgeable HR partner.

## What the AI Knows About Your Team

The AI has access to:

- Team member names and roles
- Department structure
- Reporting relationships
- Role responsibilities
- Skills and expertise areas
- Process ownership
- RACI assignments across activities

<Info>
The AI can only see information that's been entered into the system. If team details are missing, ask your admin to update the team structure.

## Cross-Team Collaboration

Find out how teams work together:

- "Which teams collaborate on product launches?"

- "What's the handoff process between sales and customer success?"

<Note>
The AI shows formal documented relationships. For informal collaboration or recent team changes not yet documented, check with your manager or HR team.
</Note>

## Contact Information

While the AI knows roles and responsibilities, contact details (email, phone) should be found through your company directory or HR system.

<Tip>
Use the AI to find who you need to contact and what they're responsible for. Then use your company directory for actual contact information.
