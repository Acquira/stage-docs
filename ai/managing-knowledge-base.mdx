<Note>
This is an **administrator-only feature**. Only users with admin privileges can manage knowledge base documents.
</Note>

## Viewing Your Knowledge Base

Access the knowledge base management interface from the admin panel:

**Admin Panel > AI Settings > Knowledge Base**

Here you'll see all uploaded documents with:

- Document title and description
- Upload date and last modified date
- File type and size
- Status (Active, Disabled, Processing)
- Number of times referenced by AI
- Category and tags

## Document Status

Each document has a status indicator:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Active" icon="circle-check">
    Available to the AI and users can query it
  </Card>

  <Card title="Disabled" icon="circle-pause">
    Uploaded but not available to AI
  </Card>

  <Card title="Processing" icon="circle-notch">
    Being processed and not yet available
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Enabling and Disabling Documents

You can control which documents the AI can access without deleting them.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Locate the document">
    Find the document in your knowledge base list.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Toggle availability">
    Click the toggle switch in the "Available to AI" column.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Confirm the change">
    The status updates immediately. Disabled documents remain in your knowledge base but the AI won't reference them.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### When to Disable Documents

Disable documents when:

- The information is temporarily outdated but you plan to update it
- You're working on a new version and want to prevent confusion
- The document is seasonal and not currently relevant
- You want to test AI responses without certain information

<Tip>
Disabling is better than deleting when you might need the document again. You can re-enable it instantly.
</Tip>

## Updating Documents

When policies or information change, update the knowledge base:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Disable the old version">
    Turn off the outdated document so the AI stops referencing it.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Upload the new version">
    Upload the updated document following the [upload process](/ai/uploading-documents).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify the update">
    Test by asking the AI a question that should be answered by the new information.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Archive the old version">
    You can delete the old version or keep it disabled for historical reference.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
Include version numbers or dates in document titles to track updates:
- "Employee Handbook 2024"
- "Remote Work Policy v3.0"
- "Travel Expense Policy (Updated March 2024)"
</Info>

## Organizing Your Knowledge Base

### Using Categories

Categories help organize documents by type:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Default Categories">
    - Policies & Procedures
    - Training & Education
    - Industry Research
    - Technical Documentation
    - Templates & Tools
    - Compliance & Legal
    - General Information
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Custom Categories">
    Create custom categories that match your organization:
    - Department-specific: "Sales Resources", "Engineering Docs"
    - Function-specific: "Customer Success", "Operations"
    - Project-specific: "Product Launch 2024", "Office Relocation"
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

To change a document's category:

1. Click the document title to open details
2. Select a new category from the dropdown
3. Save changes

### Using Tags

Tags provide flexible organization beyond categories:

```
Example tagging strategy:

Document: "Employee Remote Work Policy 2024"
Tags: HR, policy, remote-work, 2024, covid-response

Document: "Sales Compensation Plan"
Tags: sales, compensation, commission, 2024, confidential

Document: "Customer Onboarding Best Practices"
Tags: customer-success, onboarding, best-practices, training
```

<Tip>
Use consistent tag naming conventions. Decide on plural vs. singular ("policy" vs. "policies") and stick with it.
</Tip>

## Searching and Filtering

Find documents quickly using the knowledge base filters:

**Filter by Status:**
- Active documents only
- Disabled documents only
- Currently processing

**Filter by Category:**
- Select one or more categories

**Filter by Tags:**
- Click tags to filter
- Multiple tags work as AND (document must have all tags)

**Search by Name:**
- Type keywords to filter document titles and descriptions

## Viewing Document Usage

Track how often the AI references each document:

- **Reference Count** - How many times the AI has cited this document
- **Last Referenced** - When the AI last used this document
- **Common Queries** - What questions triggered this document (if available)

This helps you understand:

- Which documents are most valuable
- Which documents might be outdated or unnecessary
- What information users are seeking

<Info>
High reference counts indicate valuable content. Documents with zero references might need better organization, more relevant content, or could be removed.
</Info>

## Deleting Documents

Permanently remove documents from the knowledge base:

<Warning>
Deleting a document is permanent and cannot be undone. The AI will no longer be able to reference this information.
</Warning>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select the document">
    Find the document you want to delete.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click the delete button">
    Click the trash icon or "Delete" button.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Confirm deletion">
    Review the warning and confirm you want to permanently delete the document.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify removal">
    The document is immediately removed from the AI's knowledge base.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Before Deleting

Ask yourself:

- Is this information truly obsolete?
- Could we disable instead of delete?
- Do we have the original file backed up elsewhere?
- Might we need this information for historical reference?

## Bulk Actions

Manage multiple documents at once:

1. **Select multiple documents** using checkboxes
2. **Choose an action:**
   - Enable all selected
   - Disable all selected
   - Change category
   - Add tags
   - Delete selected

<Tip>
Use bulk actions when updating categories, disabling seasonal content, or cleaning up outdated documents.
</Tip>

## Storage Management

Monitor your knowledge base storage:

- **Current Usage**: How much space you're using
- **Total Capacity**: Your organization's storage limit
- **Largest Files**: Which documents consume most space

If approaching storage limits:

1. Review and delete truly obsolete documents
2. Compress large PDFs
3. Remove duplicate or redundant files
4. Contact support about increasing capacity

## Maintaining Document Quality

Regular maintenance keeps the knowledge base useful:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Monthly Review">
    Check for outdated documents and update information.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Quarterly Audit">
    Review usage statistics and remove unused documents.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Annual Cleanup">
    Reorganize categories, consolidate tags, and verify all content is current.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Continuous Updates">
    Update documents immediately when policies or information changes.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Version Control Best Practices

Keep track of document versions:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Include Dates in Titles" icon="calendar">
    "Travel Policy (Updated March 2024)"

    Makes it obvious which version is current
  </Card>

  <Card title="Use Version Numbers" icon="code-branch">
    "Employee Handbook v3.2"

    Clear versioning system
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

When uploading a new version:

1. Add the new version with clear title
2. Disable the old version immediately
3. Keep old version for 30 days before deleting (in case of questions)
4. Update document description to note what changed

## Document Naming Conventions

Consistent naming helps everyone:

```
Good naming pattern:
[Department] - [Document Type] - [Topic] - [Year/Version]

Examples:
"HR - Policy - Remote Work - 2024"
"Sales - Guide - Lead Qualification - v2.1"
"IT - SOP - Password Reset - 2024"
"Finance - Template - Expense Report - Current"
```
