<Note>
This is an **administrator-only feature**. Only users with admin privileges can configure API keys.
</Note>

The AI assistant uses OpenAI's API to provide intelligent responses. Before your team can use the AI features, you need to connect your OpenAI API key.

<Tip>
**Quick Access:** If you see a yellow warning banner at the bottom of your sidebar that says `Configure AI API keys`, you can click it to go directly to the API configuration page.
</Tip>

## What You'll Need

Before starting, you'll need:

- An OpenAI account (create at [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com))
- Billing information set up in your OpenAI account
- API access enabled
- Administrator access to your **Stage3** organization

<Info>
OpenAI charges for API usage based on the number of tokens (words) processed. Typical costs are very reasonable for business use, often just a few dollars per month for small to medium teams.
</Info>

## Getting Your OpenAI API Key

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create an OpenAI account">
    Go to [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com) and sign up or log in.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set up billing">
    Navigate to **Settings** > **Billing** and add your payment method.

    OpenAI requires billing information before you can use the API.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create an API key">
    Go to **API keys** section (or visit [platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)).

    Click **Create new secret key**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Name your key">
    Give it a descriptive name like "Stage3 Production" so you can identify it later.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Copy your key">
    Copy the API key immediately. OpenAI only shows it once!

    It looks like: `sk-proj-abc123...xyz789`
  </Step>

  <Step title="Store it securely">
    Save the key in a secure location temporarily. You'll enter it in the next section.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
**Important:** Never share your API key publicly or commit it to code repositories. Treat it like a password. If exposed, revoke it immediately and create a new one.
</Warning>

## Adding Your API Key to the Application

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to API Keys">
    In the main sidebar, go to **Administration > Team Settings**. On the "Settings" page, select **API Keys** from the secondary menu (under Profile, Password, and Team).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter your API key">
    Paste your OpenAI API key into the **API Key** field.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select your model">
    Choose which OpenAI model to use:
    - **GPT-4o** (recommended) - Latest, most capable model
    - **GPT-4-turbo** - Fast and high quality
    - **GPT-3.5-turbo** - Budget option, good for simple queries
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test the connection">
    Click **Test Connection** to verify the key works.

    You should see a success message.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save configuration">
    Click **Save** to activate the AI assistant for your organization.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Understanding Costs

OpenAI charges based on usage:

### How Pricing Works

- Charged per "token" (roughly ¾ of a word)
- Costs apply to both questions and answers
- Longer conversations cost more
- Complex requests cost more than simple ones

### Typical Usage Examples

Simple question + answer: "Who approves expense reports?" "Sarah Johnson, the Finance Manager, approves expense reports."

Cost: ~$0.0001 (less than 1 cent)

Complex question + detailed answer: "Explain the complete hiring process including all approval steps, timelines, and required documents."

[AI provides comprehensive 500-word answer with all details]

Cost: ~$0.01 (one cent)

Extended conversation (10 messages back and forth):

Cost: ~$0.05-0.10 (5-10 cents)


### Monthly Cost Estimates

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Small Team (10 users)">
    **Assumption:** Each user asks ~20 questions per month

    **Total questions:** 200/month

    **Estimated cost:** $2-5/month

    (Assumes mix of simple and complex questions with GPT-4o)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Medium Team (50 users)">
    **Assumption:** Each user asks ~30 questions per month

    **Total questions:** 1,500/month

    **Estimated cost:** $15-30/month

    (Active usage with detailed responses)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Large Team (200 users)">
    **Assumption:** Each user asks ~25 questions per month

    **Total questions:** 5,000/month

    **Estimated cost:** $50-100/month

    (High volume but not all users active daily)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Info>
These are estimates. Actual costs depend on question complexity, document uploads, and conversation length. Monitor your OpenAI dashboard for exact usage.
</Info>

## Monitoring Usage and Costs

Keep track of your API usage:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check OpenAI dashboard">
    Log into [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com) and go to **Usage**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="View usage metrics">
    See:
    - Daily/monthly token usage
    - Cost breakdown
    - Requests per day
    - Cost trends
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set usage limits (optional)">
    In OpenAI settings, you can set:
    - Monthly spending limits
    - Usage alerts
    - Hard caps to prevent overages
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review regularly">
    Check monthly to ensure costs align with expectations.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Set up email alerts in your OpenAI account to notify you when spending reaches certain thresholds (e.g., $25, $50, $100).
</Tip>

## Security Best Practices

Protect your API key and account:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Rotate Keys Periodically" icon="rotate">
    Change your API key every 3-6 months as a security practice.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Use Project-Specific Keys" icon="key">
    Create separate keys for production, testing, and development if applicable.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Monitor for Unusual Activity" icon="chart-line">
    Watch for unexpected spikes in usage that might indicate unauthorized access.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Revoke Compromised Keys" icon="ban">
    If you suspect a key is exposed, revoke it immediately and create a new one.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Revoking and Rotating Keys

If you need to change your API key:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a new key in OpenAI">
    Generate a new API key in your OpenAI account before revoking the old one.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Update the application">
    Replace the old key with the new key in **Administration > Team Settings > API Keys**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test the new key">
    Verify the new key works with the Test Connection button.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Revoke the old key">
    In OpenAI, revoke the old key to prevent its use.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
If you revoke a key before updating it in the application, the AI assistant will stop working immediately. Always update the application with the new key first.
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting

### "Invalid API Key" Error

**Causes:**
- Key was entered incorrectly (missing characters)
- Key was revoked in OpenAI
- Key is from wrong OpenAI account

**Solution:**
- Double-check the key for typos
- Verify the key exists and is active in OpenAI
- Generate a new key if needed

### "Insufficient Quota" Error

**Causes:**
- OpenAI account has no billing set up
- Spending limit reached
- Payment method failed

**Solution:**
- Add billing information in OpenAI
- Increase spending limits
- Update payment method

### "Connection Failed" Error

**Causes:**
- Network connectivity issues
- OpenAI API temporarily down
- Firewall blocking OpenAI domains

**Solution:**
- Check internet connection
- Check [status.openai.com](https://status.openai.com) for outages
- Ensure OpenAI API domains are not blocked

### Slow Responses

**Causes:**
- High OpenAI API load
- Large document processing
- Complex queries

**Solution:**
- Usually temporary, wait and retry
- Consider switching to GPT-4-turbo for faster responses
- Break complex questions into simpler parts

## Testing Your Setup

After configuration, test thoroughly:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Basic Test">
    Ask the AI: "What can you help me with?"

    Expected: The AI explains its capabilities
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Process Knowledge Test">
    Ask about a documented process: "What are the steps in [your process]?"

    Expected: The AI describes the process accurately
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Team Knowledge Test">
    Ask: "Who is the [role title] on our team?"

    Expected: The AI identifies the correct person
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Master Prompt Test">
    If you've uploaded documents to **AI Master Prompts**, ask a question that should be answered from those documents.

    Expected: The AI references the uploaded document
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

If all tests pass, your AI assistant is ready for your team!
