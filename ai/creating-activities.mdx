The AI assistant can help you create well-structured activities quickly. Instead of starting from scratch, describe what you need and let the AI suggest the details.

## How AI Helps with Activities

When you ask the AI to help create an activity, it can:

- Suggest appropriate task breakdowns
- Recommend RACI assignments based on your team structure
- Propose realistic timelines
- Identify dependencies
- Suggest required resources

<Tip>
Think of the AI as your planning partner. You provide the goal, and it helps you structure the work to achieve it.
</Tip>

## Starting the Conversation

Simply tell the AI what you want to create:

```
"I need to create an activity for customer onboarding."

"Help me set up a weekly team standup meeting activity."

"Can you create an activity for quarterly budget reviews?"
```

The AI will ask clarifying questions to understand your needs.

## Example: Creating a Customer Onboarding Activity

Here's how a typical conversation might go:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Make your request">
    **You:** "I need to create an activity for onboarding new enterprise customers."
  </Step>

  <Step title="AI gathers details">
    **AI:** "I'll help you create that activity. Let me ask a few questions:

    - What are the main steps in your enterprise onboarding process?
    - How long does onboarding typically take?
    - Which teams are involved?"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Provide information">
    **You:** "It usually takes 2-3 weeks. We need sales to hand off, customer success to coordinate, and IT to set up accounts."
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review AI suggestions">
    **AI:** "Based on that, here's a suggested activity structure:

    **Activity: Enterprise Customer Onboarding**

    Tasks:
    1. Sales handoff meeting (Day 1)
    2. Welcome email and resource sharing (Day 2)
    3. IT account setup (Days 2-3)
    4. Initial training session (Week 2)
    5. Check-in and support (Week 3)

    Would you like me to suggest RACI assignments?"
  </Step>
</Steps>

## AI-Suggested RACI Assignments

The AI knows your team structure and can suggest who should be:

- **Responsible** - Who does the work
- **Accountable** - Who has final authority
- **Consulted** - Who provides input
- **Informed** - Who needs to know

<Info>
The AI bases these suggestions on documented roles, past activities, and team structure. You can always adjust them to fit your specific situation.
</Info>

### Example RACI Suggestions

```
AI: "For the Enterprise Customer Onboarding activity:

Task 1: Sales Handoff Meeting
- Responsible: Sales Representative (John Smith)
- Accountable: Sales Manager (Sarah Johnson)
- Consulted: Customer Success Lead (Mike Chen)
- Informed: Account Management Team

Task 2: Welcome Email
- Responsible: Customer Success Representative
- Accountable: Customer Success Lead (Mike Chen)
- Consulted: Sales Representative
- Informed: Customer

Would you like me to continue with the other tasks?"
```

## Breaking Down Complex Activities

For large or complex activities, the AI can help you break them into manageable pieces:

```
You: "Create an activity for launching a new product."

AI: "That's a significant undertaking. I recommend breaking this
into several sub-activities:

1. Pre-launch Planning (4 weeks)
2. Marketing Campaign Development (6 weeks)
3. Sales Team Training (2 weeks)
4. Technical Preparation (4 weeks)
5. Launch Event (1 week)
6. Post-Launch Review (2 weeks)

Which of these would you like to develop first?"
```

<Tip>
Start with high-level structure, then drill down into details. This approach keeps you from getting overwhelmed.
</Tip>

## Refining AI Suggestions

You're in control. If the AI's suggestions don't quite fit, just say so:

```
You: "The timeline seems too short. Our IT setup usually takes a week."

AI: "Good point. I'll adjust the timeline:

Updated Task 3: IT Account Setup
- Duration: 1 week (Days 2-8)
- Note: Allows for complexity in enterprise setups

This shifts the training session to Week 2. Does that work better?"
```

## Learning from Existing Activities

The AI can base suggestions on similar activities you've done before:

```
You: "Create a new employee onboarding activity similar to what
we do for the sales team."

AI: "I'll use your Sales Team Onboarding activity as a template
and adapt it. Here's what I'm suggesting with the key similarities
and differences..."
```

## Common Activity Types

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Recurring Meetings">
    "Create an activity for weekly team meetings."

    AI will suggest:
    - Agenda structure
    - Regular attendees
    - Preparation tasks
    - Follow-up actions
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Project Phases">
    "Help me create an activity for the discovery phase of our project."

    AI will suggest:
    - Deliverables
    - Milestones
    - Dependencies
    - Team assignments
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Review Processes">
    "I need an activity for quarterly performance reviews."

    AI will suggest:
    - Review cycle timeline
    - Preparation requirements
    - Approval workflow
    - Documentation needs
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Event Planning">
    "Create an activity for planning our annual conference."

    AI will suggest:
    - Planning timeline
    - Task categories
    - Vendor management
    - Team coordination
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Getting Started Quickly

If you want a quick start, ask the AI for a basic template:

```
You: "Give me a basic template for a project kickoff meeting activity."

AI: "Here's a standard project kickoff template:

1. Pre-meeting: Prepare agenda and materials (1 day before)
2. Meeting: Project kickoff session (1 hour)
3. Post-meeting: Distribute notes and action items (same day)
4. Follow-up: Confirm next steps with team (1 day after)

You can customize this based on your project specifics."
```

Then you can add details specific to your situation.

## Review Before Creating

The AI provides suggestions, but you make the final decision:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Review the structure">
    Check that tasks, timeline, and assignments make sense for your situation.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Make adjustments">
    Tell the AI about any changes you want to make.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create the activity">
    Once you're happy with the plan, you can create the activity in the system.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
The AI helps you plan, but you'll still create the actual activity in the application. The AI provides the blueprint; you build it.
