## Context-Aware Assistance

The AI is smart about where you are in the application.

<Info>
When you're viewing a specific process or activity, the AI automatically knows what you're looking at. You can ask "What is this process for?" or "Who is responsible for this?" without having to explain which process you mean.
</Info>

## Always Learning

The AI has access to:

- All your documented processes and activities
- Your team structure and roles
- Uploaded knowledge base documents (if your admin has added them)
- Custom instructions (master prompts) set by your admin

This means the AI gets smarter and more helpful as your organization adds more information to the system.

## Available Anytime

<Tip>
The AI assistant is available 24/7. Whether you're working late, starting early, or just need a quick answer, it's always there to help.
</Tip>

## Natural Conversation

You don't need to use special commands or technical language. Just talk to the AI like you would talk to a helpful colleague:

- "How do I start the customer onboarding process?"
- "Who should I contact about marketing approvals?"
- "Can you help me create an activity for weekly team meetings?"
- "What documents do I need for vendor setup?"

## Privacy and Security

Your conversations with the AI are:

- Private to you and your organization
- Secured with the same protections as the rest of your data
- Used only to help you with your work

<Note>
The AI can only access information that's already in your Business Process Framework or uploaded to the knowledge base by your admin.
