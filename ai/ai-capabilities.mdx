## Using Context in Your Chats

The AI can provide answers based on specific blueprints or activities, but you must provide this context manually. The AI does not automatically know what page you are on.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Chat">
    Click the AI chat button (either the floating button or in the main sidebar).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select the [Context] Tab">
    At the top of the chat window, click the **[Context]** tab.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Context">
    From here, you can start a new session and add specific blueprints or activities to the conversation for the AI to use as a reference.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
**Context selection is only available on Core pages.** You must navigate to a Core Process page to be able to select its blueprints and activities.
</Info>

## Always Learning

The AI has access to:

- All your documented processes and activities
- Your team structure and roles
- Uploaded knowledge base documents (if your admin has added them)
- Custom instructions (**AI Master Prompts**) set by your admin

This means the AI gets smarter and more helpful as your organization adds more information to the system.

## Available Anytime

<Tip>
The AI assistant is available 24/7. Whether you're working late, starting early, or just need a quick answer, it's always there to help.
</Tip>

## Natural Conversation

You don't need to use special commands or technical language. Just talk to the AI like you would talk to a helpful colleague:

- "How do I start the customer onboarding process?"
- "Who should I contact about marketing approvals?"
- "Can you help me create an activity for weekly team meetings?"
- "What documents do I need for vendor setup?"

## Privacy and Security

Your conversations with the AI are:

- Private to you and your organization
- Secured with the same protections as the rest of your data
- Used only to help you with your work

<Note>
The AI can only access information that's already in your **Stage3** platform or uploaded to the knowledge base by your admin.
