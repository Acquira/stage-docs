description: "Understand how the AI assistant accesses and references your uploaded documents"
---

When you upload documents to the knowledge base, the AI assistant can search and reference them to provide better answers. Here's how it works behind the scenes.

## Document Processing

When a document is uploaded:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Text Extraction">
    The system extracts all readable text from the document, preserving structure like headings, paragraphs, and lists.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Content Chunking">
    The text is divided into manageable sections while maintaining context. Each section is connected to its source document.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Indexing">
    Content is indexed for fast searching, making it easy for the AI to find relevant information quickly.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Availability">
    Once processing is complete, the AI can immediately search and reference the document.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
This happens automatically in the background. Most documents are ready within a few minutes of upload.
</Info>

## How the AI Searches

When a user asks a question, the AI:

1. **Analyzes the question** to understand what information is needed
2. **Searches the knowledge base** for relevant content
3. **Retrieves matching sections** from documents
4. **Combines information** from multiple sources if needed
5. **Provides an answer** with source citations

### Example Search Process

```
User asks: "What's our policy on working from home?"

AI process:
1. Identifies keywords: policy, working from home, remote work
2. Searches knowledge base for matching content
3. Finds: "Remote Work Policy 2024" document
4. Extracts relevant sections about eligibility and requirements
5. Responds with policy details and cites the source document
```

## Source Attribution

The AI always tells users where information comes from:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Direct Quotes">
    When quoting directly from a document:

    **AI Response:**
    "According to the Employee Handbook (Section 3.4): 'All employees are eligible for up to 3 remote work days per week, subject to manager approval.'"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Summarized Information">
    When summarizing content:

    **AI Response:**
    "Based on the Travel Expense Policy, meals are reimbursed up to $50 per day for domestic travel and $75 per day for international travel."
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Multiple Sources">
    When combining information from several documents:

    **AI Response:**
    "I found information from several sources:

    From the Remote Work Policy: Equipment provision guidelines
    From the IT Security Policy: Required security measures
    From the Manager's Handbook: Approval process"
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
Source citations help users verify information and know where to find more details if needed.
</Tip>

## Relevance Ranking

Not all documents are equally relevant to every question. The AI ranks results by:

- **Keyword matches** - How well the document matches search terms
- **Context relevance** - Whether the section actually answers the question
- **Document recency** - Newer documents may be prioritized for policy questions
- **Document type** - Official policies may rank higher than general guides

This ensures users get the most relevant information first.

## Combining Sources

The AI can synthesize information from multiple documents:

```
User: "What's the complete process for hiring a contractor?"

AI combines:
- Contractor Onboarding Process (steps and timeline)
- Legal Requirements Guide (contract requirements)
- Finance Policy (payment terms)
- IT Security Policy (access provisioning)

Result: A comprehensive answer that covers all aspects
```

## Context Awareness

The AI understands context from:

1. **Previous conversation** - Remembers what you've discussed
2. **User's current page** - Knows what process or activity you're viewing
3. **Document relationships** - Understands how documents relate to each other
4. **User's role** - Can prioritize information relevant to specific roles

<Info>
This context awareness means you don't have to repeat yourself or explain which process you're asking about.
</Info>

## When Information Conflicts

If the AI finds conflicting information, it will:

1. **Note the conflict** and inform the user
2. **Compare the sources** (dates, document types)
3. **Recommend** which information is likely current
4. **Suggest** confirming with the document owner

Example:
```
AI: "I found two different procedures:

The Sales Playbook (updated March 2024) says leads should be
contacted within 24 hours.

The Manager's Guide (updated June 2023) says leads should be
contacted within 48 hours.

The Sales Playbook is more recent and likely reflects the current
standard. I recommend confirming with the Sales Manager."
```

## Document Types and Usage

Different document types serve different purposes:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Policies" icon="file-contract">
    **Used for:** Official rules, guidelines, requirements

    **AI uses to:** Answer "what's allowed" and "what's required"
  </Card>

  <Card title="Procedures & SOPs" icon="list-check">
    **Used for:** Step-by-step instructions

    **AI uses to:** Explain "how to do" something
  </Card>

  <Card title="Research & Reports" icon="chart-line">
    **Used for:** Data, insights, analysis

    **AI uses to:** Provide context and background information
  </Card>

  <Card title="Guides & Manuals" icon="book">
    **Used for:** Detailed explanations, best practices

    **AI uses to:** Offer comprehensive guidance
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Keeping Information Current

For the AI to provide accurate information:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Update documents promptly">
    When policies or procedures change, update the knowledge base immediately.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Disable outdated versions">
    Turn off old versions so the AI doesn't reference obsolete information.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Include effective dates">
    Add dates to document titles and content so everyone knows what's current.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review regularly">
    Periodically audit the knowledge base to ensure all content is up-to-date.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
Outdated documents in the knowledge base can lead to incorrect AI responses. Always disable or remove superseded documents.
</Warning>

## Privacy and Access

The AI respects document access:

- Only searches documents marked "Available to AI"
- Only provides information to authenticated users
- Maintains the same security as other system data
- Does not share information outside your organization

<Note>
The AI can only access documents uploaded to the knowledge base. It cannot access external files, databases, or systems.
</Note>

## Improving AI Responses

The quality of AI responses depends on document quality:

### Write Clear Documents

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Good Document Structure" icon="circle-check">
    - Clear headings
    - Organized sections
    - Specific procedures
    - Complete information
  </Card>

  <Card title="Poor Document Structure" icon="circle-xmark">
    - Vague headings
    - Unorganized content
    - Missing steps
    - Incomplete details
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Use Consistent Terminology

Use the same terms throughout documents:
- "Remote work" OR "work from home" (pick one)
- "Purchase request" OR "procurement request" (be consistent)
- "Expense report" OR "reimbursement claim" (use the same term)

### Include Context

Help the AI understand when and why:
- "This policy applies to full-time employees hired after January 1, 2024"
- "Use this process for purchases between $1,000 and $10,000"
- "This procedure is required for GDPR compliance"

<Tip>
Well-structured, clear documents lead to better AI responses. Invest time in document quality and the AI will be more helpful.
</Tip>

## Best Practices for Knowledge Base Content

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Be Specific">
    Instead of: "Employees may work remotely sometimes"

    Write: "Full-time employees are eligible for up to 3 remote work days per week, subject to manager approval and business needs"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Include Examples">
    "Expense reports should itemize meals by: breakfast ($15), lunch ($20), dinner ($35), with receipts for each meal over $25"

    Examples help the AI provide better guidance to users.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Define Terms">
    "Contractor (1099): An individual providing services under a service agreement, not eligible for employee benefits"

    Definitions prevent confusion and help the AI explain concepts.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Note Exceptions">
    "Standard approval limit is $5,000, except for IT purchases which require CTO approval regardless of amount"

    Exceptions are important for accurate AI responses.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
