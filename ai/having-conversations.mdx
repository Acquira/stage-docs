The AI assistant is designed to understand natural conversation. You don't need special commands or technical language. Just chat like you would with a helpful colleague.

## How to Ask Questions

The best way to get helpful answers is to ask clear, specific questions. Here's how:

### Be Specific

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Good Question" icon="circle-check">
    "How do I complete the customer onboarding process for new enterprise clients?"
  </Card>

  <Card title="Vague Question" icon="circle-xmark">
    "How does onboarding work?"
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

The more specific you are, the more helpful the AI's response will be.

### Provide Context

If the AI needs more information, it will ask. But you can save time by including relevant details upfront:

```
"I'm working on setting up a new vendor in our system.
They're based in Canada and will be providing IT services.
What's the approval process I need to follow?"
```

<Tip>
Don't worry about asking the "wrong" question. The AI can guide you to better questions if needed.
</Tip>

## Following Up

One of the best features of the AI is that it remembers your conversation. You can ask follow-up questions naturally:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Ask your first question">
    "What are the steps in our hiring process?"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Follow up naturally">
    "Who needs to approve the offer letter?"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Keep going">
    "How long does approval usually take?"
  </Step>
</Steps>

The AI understands that "approval" refers to the offer letter approval from your previous question.

## Example Conversations

Here are some examples of effective conversations:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Finding Process Information">
    **You:** "I need to submit a purchase request for new software. What's the process?"

    **AI:** "I can help you with that. The purchase request process has 4 main steps: [explains process]"

    **You:** "What's the approval limit before I need director sign-off?"

    **AI:** "For software purchases, you need director approval for anything over $5,000..."
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Getting Help with Activities">
    **You:** "Can you help me create an activity for our quarterly review meetings?"

    **AI:** "I'd be happy to help. Let me ask a few questions to create the right activity for you..."

    **You:** "We need to review financial performance, project status, and team goals."

    **AI:** "Great, here's a suggested activity structure: [provides details]"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Understanding Team Structure">
    **You:** "Who handles customer support escalations?"

    **AI:** "Customer support escalations are handled by [team member name], who is the Customer Support Manager..."

    **You:** "What if they're unavailable?"

    **AI:** "The backup contact for customer support escalations is [backup name]..."
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Tips for Better Responses

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Ask One Thing at a Time" icon="1">
    Break complex questions into smaller parts. This helps the AI give you clearer, more focused answers.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Use Complete Sentences" icon="message">
    While the AI can understand fragments, complete sentences help ensure you get exactly what you need.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Be Patient" icon="clock">
    Give the AI a moment to process and respond. Complex questions may take a few seconds.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Correct Misunderstandings" icon="rotate-left">
    If the AI misunderstands, just clarify. "No, I meant..." works perfectly.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Starting New Topics

When you want to change subjects completely, you have two options:

1. **Keep the same session:** Just start asking about the new topic. The AI will understand the subject has changed.

2. **Start a new session:** Click "New Chat" for a completely fresh start. This is helpful when switching to an unrelated topic.

<Tip>
Use new chat sessions to keep different projects or topics organized. Think of each session as a separate conversation about a specific subject.
</Tip>

## When to Rephrase

If the AI's response isn't quite what you needed, try:

- Adding more detail to your question
- Asking the question in a different way
- Breaking your question into smaller parts
- Providing an example of what you mean

The AI learns from your clarifications and will give you better answers.
