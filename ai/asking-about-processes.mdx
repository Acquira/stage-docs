The AI assistant can answer questions about your documented processes. It can explain them, provide step-by-step guidance, and help you understand how everything works.

## Adding Process Context to Your Chat

To ask questions about specific processes, you need to add them to your chat context first.

<Info>
Context selection is only available when you're on a Core Process page. Navigate to a Core Process, then use the [Context] tab in the AI chat to select which blueprints and activities you want to discuss.
</Info>

### How to Add Process Context

</Note>

## Types of Questions You Can Ask

Once you've added process context, you can ask detailed questions:

<AccordionGroup>

    - "When should I use the [process name]?"

## Getting Specific Answers

</CardGroup>

## Comparing Processes

The AI can help you understand differences between similar processes. Make sure both processes are added to your context first.

```
You: "What's the difference between the vendor onboarding
process and the contractor onboarding process?"

AI: "Based on the processes in your context:

Vendor Onboarding:
- Used for companies providing goods or services
- Requires tax documentation and insurance certificates
- Involves procurement team approval
- Takes 5-7 business days

Contractor Onboarding:
- Used for individual contractors
- Requires background check and I-9 verification
- Involves HR and hiring manager approval
- Takes 3-5 business days"
```

## Finding Related Processes

Ask the AI to help you discover related processes from those you've added to context:

- "What activities are part of the customer onboarding process?"
- "What category does [activity name] belong to?"
- "Who is responsible for most activities in [process]?"
- "What blueprints are available in [process]?"

<Tip>
If you're not sure which process to ask about, describe what you're trying to do. The AI can provide general guidance and suggest where to look in your process framework.
</Tip>

## Understanding Process Details

Ask about specific elements of processes you've added to context:

```
You: "What are the RACI assignments for the budget approval activity?"

AI: "In the budget approval activity:
- Responsible: Finance Team
- Accountable: CFO
- Consulted: Department Head
- Informed: Project Manager"
```

## Example Questions by Scenario

<Steps>
  <Step title="Starting Something New">
    "What are the first steps in the employee onboarding process?"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Understanding an Activity">
    "What does the 'Initial Assessment' activity involve in the customer onboarding process?"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Finding Requirements">
    "What documents are needed for the vendor approval process?"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Understanding Responsibilities">
    "Who is accountable for the contract review activity?"
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Best Practices

**Be Specific with Process Names**  
Mention the exact process or activity name when asking questions for the most accurate answers.

**Add Relevant Context First**  
Make sure the processes you want to ask about are added to your context through the [Context] tab.

**Ask Follow-Up Questions**  
You can have a conversation about the processes in your context. Ask clarifying questions as needed.

**Navigate to Core Pages**  
Remember that context selection only works when you're viewing a Core Process page.

<Note>
The AI can only provide detailed answers about processes that you've added to the chat context. If you need information about a different process, use the [Context] tab to add it first.
</Note>

## Limitations

**Context Must Be Selected Manually**  
The AI doesn't automatically know which process you're viewing. You need to select it in the [Context] tab.

**Only Works on Core Pages**  
Context selection is only available when viewing Core Process pages, not on the Dashboard or other sections.

**Based on Documented Information**  
The AI can only tell you about processes that have been documented and added to your context.
