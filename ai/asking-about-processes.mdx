The AI assistant has deep knowledge of all your documented processes. It can explain them, answer questions, and help you understand how everything works.

## Context-Aware Help

One of the most powerful features is context awareness. When you're viewing a process in the app, the AI automatically knows which one you're looking at.

<Info>
You can ask "What is this process for?" or "Who owns this?" without having to specify which process you mean. The AI knows you're talking about what's on your screen.
</Info>

### Example: On a Process Page

```
You're viewing: "Customer Onboarding Process"

You ask: "What are the main steps?"

AI responds: "The Customer Onboarding Process has 5 main steps:
1. Initial contact and qualification
2. Needs assessment
3. Solution design
4. Contract negotiation
5. Implementation kickoff"
```

## Comparing Processes

The AI can help you understand differences between similar processes:

```
You: "What's the difference between the vendor onboarding
process and the contractor onboarding process?"

AI: "Great question! Here are the key differences:

Vendor Onboarding:
- Used for companies providing goods or services
- Requires tax documentation and insurance certificates
- Involves procurement team approval
- Takes 5-7 business days

Contractor Onboarding:
- Used for individual contractors
- Requires background check and I-9 verification
- Involves HR and hiring manager approval
- Takes 3-5 business days"
```

## Finding Related Processes

Ask the AI to help you discover related processes:

- "What other processes are related to customer onboarding?"
- "What process comes after this one?"
- "What processes does the sales team use most?"
- "Show me all the approval processes"

<Tip>
If you're not sure which process to use, describe what you're trying to do. The AI can recommend the right process for your situation.
</Tip>

## Understanding Process Changes

If a process has been recently updated, the AI can help:

```
You: "Has the expense approval process changed recently?"

AI: "Yes, the expense approval process was updated last month.
The main change is that expenses over $500 now require
department head approval, whereas previously the limit was $1,000."
```

## When You Don't Know the Process Name

You don't need to know the exact name of a process. Just describe what you're trying to do:

```
Instead of: "What is the PRQ-2024-001 process?"

Just ask: "How do I get approval to buy new office furniture?"
```

The AI will identify the right process for you.

<Note>
The AI can only tell you about processes that have been documented in your system. If you can't find what you're looking for, ask your process owner or admin to add it.
