    - Process = Recipe
    - Workflow = Cooking that recipe for tonight's dinner

    **Relationship:**
    - You create a process once
    - You start workflows from that process many times
    - Each workflow tracks one execution of the process
  </Accordion>

    **Permission Required:**
    - Anyone assigned to a task can reassign it

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens if I miss a task deadline?">
    **Overdue Tasks:**
    - Task is automatically marked as overdue
    - Appears in red in your task list
    - Notifications sent to you and your manager
    - Workflow may be marked as "at risk"

    **What to Do:**

    - Escalations: Auto-escalate overdue tasks

    **Integration Triggers:**
