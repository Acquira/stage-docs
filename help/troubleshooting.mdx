## Login & Access Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="I can't log in - 'Invalid credentials' error">
    **Possible Causes & Solutions:**

    **1. Incorrect Password**
    - Verify Caps Lock is off
    - Check for extra spaces before/after username or password
    - Try typing password in a text editor first to verify it
    - [Reset your password](/help/faq#i-forgot-my-password-how-do-i-reset-it)

    **2. Account Not Yet Provisioned**
    - New employees: Check if IT has created your account
    - Contact your system administrator
    - Account creation can take 24-48 hours

    **3. Account Locked**
    - After 5 failed login attempts, accounts lock for 30 minutes
    - Wait 30 minutes and try again
    - Or contact support for immediate unlock

    **4. Using Wrong Login Method**
    - Does your company use SSO? Click "Sign in with SSO" instead
    - Check with IT about which login method to use

    **5. Browser Autofill Issue**
    - Clear saved credentials from browser
    - Try typing credentials manually
    - Try a different browser or incognito mode
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="SSO login isn't working">
    **Troubleshooting SSO Issues:**

    **1. Wrong Email Domain**
    - Use your company email address (not personal email)
    - SSO only works with authorized email domains

    **2. Not Redirecting to SSO Provider**
    - Clear browser cache and cookies
    - Try a different browser
    - Check if popup blocker is preventing redirect

    **3. SSO Error After Redirect**
    - Verify you're logged into your company SSO (Google, Microsoft, Okta, etc.)
    - Try logging out of SSO provider, then back in
    - Check SSO provider status page for outages

    **4. "Not Authorized" Error**
    - Your company admin may not have granted you access
    - Contact your system administrator
    - Your account may need to be added to the SSO app

    **5. Works on Desktop but Not Mobile**
    - Install your company's authenticator app if required
    - Some SSO providers require specific mobile configuration
    - Contact IT for mobile SSO setup help

    **Still Not Working?**
    - Screenshot the error message
    - Note which SSO provider you're using (Google, Microsoft, etc.)
    - [Contact support](/help/getting-support) with this information
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="'Session Expired' keeps appearing">
    **Why This Happens:**
    For security, sessions expire after a period of inactivity.

    **Default Session Timeout:**
    - 8 hours of inactivity
    - 24 hours maximum (even if active)

    **Solutions:**

    **1. Re-authenticate**
    - Click "Log in again" when prompted
    - Your work is auto-saved (unless noted otherwise)

    **2. Enable "Remember Me"**
    - Check "Remember Me" at login
    - Extends session to 30 days (less secure)
    - Not recommended on shared computers

    **3. Keep Browser Tab Active**
    - Browser activity keeps session alive
    - Don't close browser for extended periods

    **4. Check for Clock Skew**
    - Ensure your computer's clock is accurate
    - Significant time differences can cause session issues
    - Enable automatic time sync in OS settings

    **If Expiring Too Frequently:**
    - Your organization may have stricter session policies
    - Contact your administrator about session settings
    - May be required for compliance reasons
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="I have access but can't see certain processes">
    **Possible Reasons:**

    **1. Permission Restrictions**
    - Process may be restricted to certain roles or departments
    - Contact process owner to request access
    - Your manager can usually grant access

    **2. Process is Archived**
    - Archived processes don't show by default
    - Enable "Show Archived" filter in process list
    - Archived processes are read-only

    **3. Process is Draft**
    - Draft processes only visible to owner and collaborators
    - Won't appear in search until published
    - Ask process owner to add you as collaborator

    **4. Wrong Organization Account**
    - Verify you're logged into correct organization
    - Check URL: should be yourcompany.processframework.com
    - Some users have accounts in multiple organizations

    **5. Search Filter Active**
    - Check if filters are limiting results
    - Clear all filters and search again
    - Try browsing instead of searching

    **Verification Steps:**
    1. Ask a colleague if they can see the process
    2. If they can: It's a permission issue
    3. If they can't: Process may not exist or wrong name

    **1. Index Rebuilding**
    - Search index rebuilds after major updates
    - Can take 30-60 minutes
    - Check back later

    **2. Too Broad Search**
    - Very generic terms return thousands of results
    - Use more specific keywords

    - Visit status.processframework.com

    **2. Use Browse Instead**
    - Navigate via departments/categories

    - Check recently updated processes

    **3. Contact Support**
    - If search is completely broken
    - Provide example search terms that don't work

    - Auto-save requires active connection
    - Check connection indicator (top right corner)
    - If offline, work is saved locally and syncs when reconnected

    **4. Concurrent Editing**
    - Another user may be editing same process
    - System prevents conflicting saves
    - Wait for other user to finish
    - Or coordinate to edit different sections

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="'Permission denied' error when editing">
    **Why This Happens:**
    You're trying to edit something you don't have permission to change.

    **Scenarios:**

    **1. Published Process**
    - Only process owner can edit published processes
    - Request owner to make you a collaborator
    - Or submit change request to owner

    **2. Locked by Another User**
    - Someone else is currently editing
    - Wait for them to finish (usually auto-unlocks after 30 min)
    - Contact user to coordinate

    **3. Read-Only Access**
    - You have view-only permission
    - Contact process owner to upgrade to edit access
    - Or create a copy to edit your own version

    **4. Archived Process**
    - Archived processes are read-only
    - Must unarchive before editing
    - Only owner/admin can unarchive

    **5. Insufficient Role**
    - Your user role doesn't allow editing
    - Contributors can edit drafts but not published
    - Request role upgrade from administrator

    **Checking Your Permission:**
    1. Open the process
    2. Look for "Edit" button
    3. If missing: You don't have edit access
    4. Click process name → "Info" to see who owns it

    **Requesting Access:**
    1. Note the process owner name
    2. Send them a message or email
    3. Explain why you need edit access
    4. Owner can add you in Settings → Collaborators
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can't delete an activity or process">
    **Deletion Issues:**

    **1. Permission Required**
    - Only process owner or admin can delete
    - Verify your role has deletion rights
    - Contact owner if you need something deleted

    **2. Process is Published**
    - Published processes can't be deleted (only archived)
    - Archive instead: Settings → Archive Process
    - Prevents accidental deletion of active processes

    **3. Activity Has Dependencies**
    - Activities with tasks can't be deleted
    - Must complete or reassign tasks first
    - Or delete the entire workflow

    **4. Referenced by Other Processes**
    - Process linked from other processes
    - Update links first
    - Or use archive (links still work)

    **5. Active Workflows**
    - Can't delete process with active workflows
    - Complete or cancel workflows first
    - Or wait for workflows to finish

    **Safe Deletion Steps:**
    1. Check for active workflows or tasks
    2. Update any links from other processes
    3. Archive instead of delete (reversible)
    4. Only delete if absolutely certain

    **Recovery:**
    - Deleted items move to "Trash" for 30 days
    - Restore from trash if deleted by mistake
    - After 30 days, deletion is permanent
