## Writing Principles

### 1. Write for Your Audience

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Know Who Will Read This">
    **Questions to Ask:**
    - What is their role and experience level?
    - How familiar are they with the domain?
    - What's their technical proficiency?
    - Will they read this once or reference it repeatedly?

    **Example: Bad**
    "Execute the ETL pipeline using the batch processor"

    **Example: Good (for non-technical audience)**
    "Run the nightly data import by clicking the 'Import Data' button in the admin panel"

    **Example: Good (for technical audience)**
    "Trigger the ETL pipeline: `./scripts/run-etl.sh --env=production`"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Match Their Context">
    **For New Employees:**
    - Define acronyms and jargon
    - Provide more context and background
    - Include links to related concepts
    - Add screenshots and examples

    **For Experienced Team Members:**
    - Skip basic explanations
    - Focus on edge cases and gotchas
    - Provide technical details
    - Link to related processes

    **For Executives:**
    - Lead with outcomes and business impact
    - Minimize operational detail
    - Focus on decisions and approvals
    - Highlight KPIs and metrics
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Appropriate Language Level">
    **General Principles:**
    - Use active voice ("Complete the form" not "The form should be completed")
    - Use present tense ("Click Save" not "You will click Save")
    - Use second person ("You" not "The user" or "One")
    - Keep sentences short (under 25 words)
    - Use simple words (prefer "use" over "utilize")

    **Readability Target:**
    - Internal docs: 8th-10th grade reading level
    - Customer-facing: 6th-8th grade reading level
    - Technical docs: Can be higher, but clarity still matters
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### 2. Structure for Scannability

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Use Headings" icon="heading">
    Break content into logical sections with descriptive headings

    **Good:** "Submitting Your Expense Report"
    **Bad:** "Step 3"
  </Card>

  <Card title="Use Lists" icon="list">
    Convert paragraphs to bulleted or numbered lists when possible

    Lists are easier to scan than dense paragraphs
  </Card>

  <Card title="Use Visual Hierarchy" icon="layer-group">
    Use formatting to show importance:
    - Bold for key terms
    - *Italics* for emphasis
    - `Code formatting` for technical terms
    - Callout boxes for important notes
  </Card>

  <Card title="Front-Load Information" icon="arrow-up">
    Put the most important information first

    Lead with the answer, then provide details
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### 3. Be Specific and Actionable

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Vague vs Specific">
    **Vague:**
    "Follow up with the customer"

    **Specific:**
    "Send a follow-up email to the customer within 24 hours of the demo, using the 'Post-Demo Follow-Up' template"

    ---

    **Vague:**
    "Review the proposal"

    **Specific:**
    "Review the proposal for accurate pricing, correct legal terms, and alignment with discussed scope. Use the Proposal Checklist."

    ---

    **Vague:**
    "Get approval"

    **Specific:**
    "Obtain written approval via email from your direct manager. For requests over $10,000, also get VP approval."
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Use Action Verbs">
    Start instructions with strong action verbs:

    **Good Verbs:**
    - Click, select, enter, complete
    - Review, verify, validate, confirm
    - Send, submit, upload, download
    - Create, update, delete, archive
    - Approve, reject, escalate, assign

    **Avoid Vague Verbs:**
    - Do, handle, process, manage
    - Deal with, take care of, work on
    - Make sure, ensure, check
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Provide Context">
    Explain the "why" when it's not obvious:

    **Without Context:**
    "CC the sales manager on all proposal emails"

    **With Context:**
    "CC the sales manager on all proposal emails so they can track pipeline progress and jump in if needed"

    ---

    **Without Context:**
    "Always test in staging before production"

    **With Context:**
    "Always test in staging before production to catch bugs before they affect customers. Staging mirrors production configuration."
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Example SOP: Processing a Refund

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="View Complete SOP Example">
    # Process Customer Refund

    ## Purpose
    This SOP ensures refunds are processed quickly, accurately, and in compliance with company refund policies.

    ## When to Use This
    Use this procedure when a customer requests a refund for any purchase within 30 days of transaction.

    ## Prerequisites
    - Customer account information (email or account ID)
    - Original order number
    - Reason for refund request
    - Manager approval (for refunds over $500)

    ## Estimated Time
    10-15 minutes

    ## Steps

    ### 1. Verify Refund Eligibility
    1. Look up the order in the admin system using order number
    2. Check the order date (must be within 30 days)
    3. Verify the order status is "Delivered" or "Completed"
    4. Check if a previous refund was already issued (cannot refund twice)

    **Example:**
    Order #12345 placed on March 1st → Today is March 15th → Eligible (within 30 days)

    **Tips:**
    - If the order is outside 30 days, check if customer is Premium member (they get 60 days)
    - Digital products cannot be refunded after download

    ### 2. Obtain Approval (if needed)
    If refund amount is over $500:
    1. Send Slack message to your manager with order details
    2. Include customer reason for refund
    3. Wait for approval before proceeding
    4. Document approval in the order notes

    ### 3. Process the Refund
    1. In the admin system, navigate to Orders > [Order Number]
    2. Click the "Issue Refund" button
    3. Enter refund amount (usually full amount)
    4. Select refund reason from dropdown
    5. Add notes explaining the situation
    6. Click "Process Refund"
    7. Wait for confirmation message (appears in 3-5 seconds)

    **Common Issues:**
    - **Problem:** "Refund Failed" error message appears
    - **Solution:** Check if payment method is still valid. If card expired, escalate to Finance team

    ### 4. Notify Customer
    1. Use the "Refund Confirmation" email template
    2. Include order number and refund amount
    3. Explain refund will appear in 5-7 business days
    4. Send the email

    **Example Email:**
    ```
    Subject: Refund Processed for Order #12345

    Hi [Customer Name],

    Your refund of $150.00 for order #12345 has been processed.

    The refund will appear on your original payment method within 5-7 business days.

    If you have any questions, reply to this email.

    Best regards,
    [Your Name]
    Customer Support Team
    ```

    ### 5. Document in CRM
    1. Create a note in the customer's CRM record
    2. Note: "Refund processed: $[amount] for order #[number]. Reason: [reason]"
    3. Add tag: "Refund-Issued"
    4. Save the note

    ## Verification
    You've completed this correctly if:
    - Order status shows "Refunded" in admin system
    - Customer received confirmation email
    - CRM note is created
    - Manager approval is documented (if required)

    ## Troubleshooting

    **Problem:** Payment method no longer valid
    **Solution:** Escalate to Finance team. They can issue refund via check or bank transfer.

    **Problem:** Customer wants partial refund
    **Solution:** Only full refunds allowed. If customer wants to keep some items, process full refund then create new order for items they want to keep.

    **Problem:** Refund button is grayed out
    **Solution:** Order may still be processing. Wait 1 hour and try again. If still grayed out, contact Technical Support.

## Using Visual Aids

### When to Use Screenshots

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Do Use Screenshots" icon="check">
    - Complex UI with many options
    - Specific fields to complete
    - Non-obvious button locations
    - Confirmation messages to expect
  </Card>

  <Card title="Don't Use Screenshots" icon="xmark">
    - Simple actions ("Click Save")
    - UIs that change frequently
    - When text description is clearer
    - For every single step (too many)
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

**Screenshot Best Practices:**
- Annotate with arrows and labels
- Crop to show only relevant area
- Use consistent styling across all screenshots
- Add captions explaining what the image shows
- Update regularly when UI changes

### When to Use Diagrams

**Flow Diagrams:** Show process flow and decision points

**Use For:**
- Process with multiple branches
- Decision trees
- Complex logic flows

**Architecture Diagrams:** Show system components and relationships

**Use For:**
- Technical integrations
- Data flows
- System dependencies

**Swim Lane Diagrams:** Show activities across different roles/departments

**Use For:**
- Cross-functional processes
- Handoffs between teams
- Parallel activities

<Tip>
Keep diagrams simple. If your diagram has more than 15 boxes, it's probably too complex. Break it into multiple diagrams.
</Tip>

### When to Use Tables

**Use Tables For:**
- Comparing options
- Listing specifications
- Showing RACI assignments
- Reference data

**Table Best Practices:**
- Keep tables simple (5-7 columns maximum)
- Use clear column headers
- Left-align text, right-align numbers
- Use zebra striping for readability
- Make tables responsive on mobile

### When to Use Callout Boxes

    </Warning>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Info">
    <Info>
    Use Info boxes for contextual information or background.

    Example: "This process was updated in March 2024 to comply with new regulations"
    </Info>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Keeping Documentation Current

## Common Documentation Mistakes

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Writing for Yourself, Not the Reader">
    **Mistake:** Assuming readers have your level of knowledge

    **Example:**
    "Run the ETL job to sync the data warehouse"

    **Problem:** Assumes reader knows what ETL is, where to run it, and how often

    **Fix:**
    "Each morning at 9 AM, log into the Data Admin panel and click 'Run Data Import' to update the reports with yesterday's sales data."
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Using Vague Language">
    **Mistake:** Instructions that can be interpreted multiple ways

    **Examples of Vague Language:**
    - "Soon" → Within 24 hours
    - "Several" → 3-5
    - "Quickly" → Within 2 minutes
    - "Often" → 2-3 times per week
    - "Large file" → Files over 10 MB

    **Fix:** Replace vague terms with specific numbers, timeframes, and criteria
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Skipping the 'Why'">
    **Mistake:** Only explaining what to do, not why it matters

    **Example:**
    "Always CC your manager on customer emails"

    **Better:**
    "Always CC your manager on customer emails so they can jump in if the issue escalates and have context for performance reviews"

    **When to Include Why:**
    - When the reason isn't obvious
    - When it prevents common mistakes
    - When it helps with troubleshooting
    - When it builds better understanding
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Death by Screenshot">
    **Mistake:** Including a screenshot for every single step

    **Problems:**
    - Makes documentation very long
    - Screenshots become outdated quickly
    - Slower to update when UI changes
    - Harder to scan for specific information

    **Fix:** Only use screenshots for complex UIs or non-obvious actions. For simple actions, text is sufficient.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="No Examples">
    **Mistake:** Only providing abstract instructions without concrete examples

    **Abstract:**
    "Enter the customer reference number in the appropriate field"

    **With Example:**
    "Enter the customer reference number in the 'Ref ID' field. Example: CUS-2024-001234"

    **Fix:** Include at least one example per major step
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Never Updating">
    **Mistake:** Writing documentation once and never revising

    **Result:**
    - Screenshots show old UI
    - References to tools that no longer exist
    - Steps that don't match current process
    - Users lose trust in documentation

    **Fix:** Establish regular review schedule and assign owner to keep current
