## When to Create a New Version

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Major Version">
    ### Major Version (1.0 → 2.0)

    **Create When:**
    - Complete process restructure
    - Major philosophical or approach changes
    - New category structure
    - Significant additions/removals (>30% of activities)

    **Examples:**
    - Switching from waterfall to agile development
    - Merging two processes into one
    - Adding compliance requirements that change everything
    - Complete rewrite based on process improvement project

    **Change Log:**
    Document major changes in detail with rationale

    **Communication:**
    Notify all stakeholders, conduct training if needed

    <Warning>
    Major version changes may require retraining and significant documentation updates.
    </Warning>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Minor Version">
    ### Minor Version (1.0 → 1.1)

    **Create When:**
    - Adding new activities (10-30% change)
    - Modifying existing activities significantly
    - Changing RACI assignments broadly
    - Updating KPI targets or definitions
    - Adding new categories

    **Examples:**
    - Adding 5 new activities to 20-activity process
    - Changing approval workflows
    - Introducing new roles to RACI matrix
    - Updating forms and templates

    **Change Log:**
    List what changed and why

    **Communication:**
    Email summary to process participants

    <Note>
    Minor versions are improvements to existing structure, not fundamental changes.
    </Note>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Patch Version">
    ### Patch Version (1.0.0 → 1.0.1)

    **Create When:**
    - Fixing typos or errors
    - Clarifying instructions
    - Updating screenshots
    - Correcting data or links
    - Small RACI adjustments

    **Examples:**
    - Fixing spelling mistakes
    - Updating outdated screenshots
    - Correcting contact information
    - Clarifying ambiguous wording

    **Change Log:**
    Brief note of correction

    **Communication:**
    No announcement needed (unless it's a critical fix)

    <Tip>
    Batch small fixes and release them together rather than creating many tiny versions.
    </Tip>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Don't Version">
    ### When NOT to Create a New Version

    **Don't version these changes:**
    - Formatting adjustments
    - Cosmetic changes (colors, fonts)
    - Adding examples without changing steps
    - Reordering without changing content
    - Updates to timestamps or "last modified" dates

    **Why Not:**
    These don't affect how the process is executed

    **Instead:**
    Make the change without incrementing version number

    <Note>
    Only version changes that affect process execution or understanding.
    </Note>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Version Numbering System

### Semantic Versioning

Use a three-part version number: **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH**

**Example: Version 2.3.1**
- **2** = Major version (significant restructure)
- **3** = Minor version (3rd set of improvements to v2)
- **1** = Patch (1st bug fix to v2.3)

### Version Progression Examples

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="New Process Creation">
    **Start:** 1.0

    A new process always begins at version 1.0 (not 0.1 or 1.0.0)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Small Improvements">
    1.0 → 1.1 → 1.2 → 1.3

    Each minor improvement increments the minor version
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Bug Fixes">
    1.2 → 1.2.1 → 1.2.2

    Patches increment the third number without changing minor version
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Major Overhaul">
    1.9 → 2.0

    Major changes jump to next major version, resetting minor and patch to 0
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Combined Changes">
    **Scenario:** You make bug fixes and improvements together

    1.2.1 → 1.3

    When combining patch and minor changes, increment to next minor version (patches are already included)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
Keep version numbers simple. Don't overthink it. The goal is clarity, not precision.
</Tip>

  <Card title="Use Action Verbs" icon="bolt">
    - Added [thing]
    - Changed [thing]
    - Removed [thing]
    - Fixed [thing]
    - Deprecated [thing]
  </Card>

  <Card title="Be Specific" icon="magnifying-glass">
    **Vague:** "Updated activities"
    **Specific:** "Added 3 activities to Quality Assurance category"
  </Card>

  <Card title="Include Context" icon="circle-info">

    "See process improvement initiative #456"
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Note>
Keep change logs in reverse chronological order (newest first) so users see recent changes immediately.
</Note>

## Collaboration Best Practices

### Editing Workflows

<Steps>
  <Step title="Propose Changes">
    Don't edit production processes directly. Create a draft or proposal first.

    **Options:**
    - Draft version in separate document
    - Comments/suggestions in review tool
    - Formal change request
  </Step>

  <Step title="Get Review">
    Have changes reviewed by:
    - Process owner (required)
    - Subject matter experts (for technical accuracy)
    - Regular process users (for usability)
    - Compliance/legal (if applicable)

    **Minimum:** Process owner approval required
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test Changes">
    For significant changes:
    - Pilot with small team first
    - Run parallel with old process temporarily
    - Gather feedback before full rollout

    **Example:** Test new approval workflow with one department for 2 weeks
  </Step>

  <Step title="Publish New Version">
    Once approved:
    - Update version number
    - Add change log entry
    - Update "last modified" date and author
    - Notify stakeholders
  </Step>

  <Step title="Deprecate Old Version">
    Mark previous version as deprecated but keep accessible for reference period (30-90 days)
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Avoiding Edit Conflicts

**Problem:** Two people edit the same process simultaneously, creating conflicts

**Solutions:**

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Lock While Editing">
    **Method:** System prevents simultaneous editing

    **Pros:** No conflicts possible
    **Cons:** One person blocked if another has it open

    **Best For:** Small teams, infrequent edits
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Change Proposals">
    **Method:** Editors propose changes, owner merges them

    **Pros:** Multiple people can propose changes
    **Cons:** Owner bottleneck

    **Best For:** Processes with high change volume
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Scheduled Maintenance Windows">
    **Method:** Designate specific times for edits (e.g., Friday afternoons)

    **Pros:** Predictable, no conflicts
    **Cons:** Delays urgent updates

    **Best For:** Stable processes with planned updates
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Section Ownership">
    **Method:** Different people own different sections

    **Pros:** Parallel editing without conflicts
    **Cons:** Need clear boundaries

    **Best For:** Large processes with natural divisions
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Review Checklists

**Before Publishing a New Version:**

**Content Review**
- [ ] All changes are accurate and complete
- [ ] No typos or grammatical errors
- [ ] Links and references work correctly
- [ ] Screenshots are current
- [ ] Examples reflect current state

**Technical Review**
- [ ] Process is technically feasible
- [ ] Tool/system capabilities support the process
- [ ] Integrations and dependencies are accurate
- [ ] RACI assignments are realistic

**Compliance Review**
- [ ] Meets regulatory requirements (if applicable)
- [ ] Follows company policies
- [ ] Security and privacy considerations addressed
- [ ] Audit trail requirements met

**Usability Review**
- [ ] Instructions are clear and actionable
- [ ] Process flow is logical
- [ ] Appropriate level of detail
- [ ] Users can find what they need

**Change Management**
- [ ] Change log is updated
- [ ] Version number incremented correctly
- [ ] Stakeholders notified
- [ ] Training scheduled (if needed)

<Tip>
Use a formal checklist for major versions to ensure nothing is missed. Minor versions can use a simplified checklist.
</Tip>

## Restoring Previous Versions

### When to Roll Back

**Consider restoring a previous version when:**
- New version has critical errors
- Process changes caused unexpected problems
- Compliance issues discovered
- Team feedback indicates the changes aren't working
- Results are worse than with previous version

<Warning>
Rolling back should be rare. If you're frequently reverting changes, your review process needs improvement.
</Warning>

### How to Roll Back

<Steps>
  <Step title="Assess the Situation">
    - What specific problems does the new version have?
    - Can they be quickly fixed, or is rollback necessary?
    - How urgently do you need to act?
  </Step>

  <Step title="Communicate the Plan">
    Notify all process users:
    - We're reverting to version X.X
    - Here's why (brief explanation)
    - Here's what happens next
    - Timeline for fix and re-release
  </Step>

  <Step title="Restore Previous Version">
    - Mark current version as "Deprecated - Do Not Use"
    - Republish previous version as current
    - Update version notes explaining the rollback
  </Step>

  <Step title="Fix Issues">
    - Address the problems in the reverted version
    - Test thoroughly before republishing
    - Document what went wrong for future learning
  </Step>

  <Step title="Release Fixed Version">
    - Publish corrected version with new version number
    - Explain what was fixed
    - Thank team for patience
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Version History Retention

**How Long to Keep Old Versions:**

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Current Version" icon="check">
    **Keep:** Forever (obviously)

    This is the active process everyone uses
  </Card>

  <Card title="Previous Version" icon="clock">
    **Keep:** 90 days after superseded

    Easy access in case you need to reference or revert
  </Card>

  <Card title="Historical Versions" icon="archive">
    **Keep:** 2-7 years (depends on compliance needs)

    Archive but don't delete (may need for audits)
  </Card>

  <Card title="Draft/Test Versions" icon="trash">
    **Keep:** 30 days after release or rejection

    Delete once no longer needed
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Note>
Compliance requirements may mandate longer retention. Consult with legal/compliance teams for regulated processes.
</Note>

## Handling Process Deprecation

### When to Deprecate a Process

**Deprecate when:**
- Process is being replaced by a new process
- Process is no longer needed (business change)
- Process has been merged into another process
- Tool/system that enabled process is being retired

### Deprecation Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Announce Deprecation">
    **Notice Period:** Minimum 30 days before removal

    **Announcement Should Include:**
    - What's being deprecated and when
    - Why it's being deprecated
    - What replaces it (if anything)
    - What users need to do
    - Who to contact with questions

    **Example:**
    "The Legacy Sales Process (v3.2) will be deprecated on 5/1/2024 and replaced by the Modern Sales Process (v1.0). All teams must transition by 4/15/2024. Training sessions available 3/20-4/10."
  </Step>

  <Step title="Mark as Deprecated">
    Add prominent notice to the process:

    ```
    ⚠️ DEPRECATED - This process is no longer maintained
    Deprecated: March 1, 2024
    Replacement: [Link to new process]
    Support ends: May 1, 2024
    ```

    Make it impossible to miss
  </Step>

  <Step title="Support Transition">
    - Provide migration guide
    - Offer training on replacement
    - Answer questions
    - Monitor adoption of new process
    - Provide grace period for stragglers
  </Step>

  <Step title="Archive (Don't Delete)">
    After deprecation period:
    - Move to archive section
    - Keep accessible but not in main navigation
    - Maintain for historical reference
    - Document archive date and reason
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
Never delete a process without archiving. You may need it for audit trails, legal holds, or historical reference.
</Warning>

## Version Control Mistakes to Avoid

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Not Versioning at All">
    **Problem:** Making changes without tracking versions

    **Result:**
    - No audit trail
    - Can't revert changes
    - Confusion about which version is current
    - Compliance issues

    **Fix:** Implement version numbering from day one
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Version Number Chaos">
    **Problem:** Inconsistent versioning system

    **Examples:**
    - v1, v2, v2.1, v2.1a, v2.1-final, v2.1-final-FINAL

    **Fix:** Choose a versioning system (semantic versioning) and stick to it
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="No Change Log">
    **Problem:** Incrementing version number without documenting changes

    **Result:**
    - Users don't know what changed
    - Can't understand why changes were made
    - Difficult to troubleshoot issues

    **Fix:** Always document what changed and why
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Skipping Review">
    **Problem:** Publishing changes without review

    **Result:**
    - Errors make it into production
    - Changes conflict with other processes
    - Compliance violations

    **Fix:** Require process owner approval at minimum
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Overversioning">
    **Problem:** Creating new version for every tiny change

    **Examples:**
    - v1.0.1: Fixed typo in step 3
    - v1.0.2: Fixed typo in step 5
    - v1.0.3: Updated screenshot

    **Result:** Version number inflation, change fatigue

    **Fix:** Batch small fixes into single version update
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="No Deprecation Notice">
    **Problem:** Replacing a process without warning

    **Result:**
    - Team members still use old process
    - Confusion about which process to follow
    - Training gaps

    **Fix:** Always provide deprecation notice and transition period
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
