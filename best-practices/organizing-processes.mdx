## Core Principles

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Start Simple" icon="seedling">
    Begin with essential activities only. You can always add detail later as the process matures.
  </Card>

  <Card title="User-Centric" icon="user">
    Organize processes the way your team thinks about the work, not how the software works.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Consistent Structure" icon="grid">
    Use consistent naming conventions and organization patterns across all processes.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Logical Flow" icon="arrow-right">
    Arrange activities in the order they're actually performed, not alphabetically.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Organizing by Category

### Why Use Categories?

Categories group related activities into logical phases or stages. They help users:
- Quickly find relevant activities
- Understand process flow at a glance
- Focus on one stage at a time
- Track progress through the process

### Category Organization Approaches

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Chronological">
    **Best for:** Sequential processes with clear phases

    **Example: Sales Process**
    - Prospecting
    - Qualification
    - Presentation
    - Closing
    - Post-Sale

    **Advantages:**
    - Mirrors actual workflow
    - Easy to understand progression
    - Natural for time-based processes

    **When to Use:**
    - Linear processes
    - Clear beginning and end
    - Activities follow a sequence
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Functional">
    **Best for:** Processes involving multiple departments

    **Example: Product Launch**
    - Product Management
    - Engineering
    - Marketing
    - Sales Enablement
    - Customer Support

    **Advantages:**
    - Clear ownership by department
    - Easy to assign to teams
    - Parallel work visible

    **When to Use:**
    - Cross-functional initiatives
    - Multiple teams working simultaneously
    - Department-specific responsibilities
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Thematic">
    **Best for:** Processes with recurring themes or types of work

    **Example: Customer Onboarding**
    - Technical Setup
    - Training & Education
    - User Adoption
    - Success Validation

    **Advantages:**
    - Groups similar work together
    - Flexible for non-linear processes
    - Easy to find related activities

    **When to Use:**
    - Complex processes without strict sequence
    - Multiple parallel workstreams
    - Processes with recurring patterns
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Priority-Based">
    **Best for:** Processes where order is less important than priority

    **Example: Incident Response**
    - Critical Actions (First 15 min)
    - Stabilization (First hour)
    - Investigation (First 24 hours)
    - Resolution & Prevention

    **Advantages:**
    - Emphasizes urgency
    - Clear time-based expectations
    - Focuses on outcomes

    **When to Use:**
    - Time-sensitive processes
    - Emergency or crisis management
    - When speed matters more than sequence
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Category Naming Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use Clear, Descriptive Names">
    **Good Examples:**
    - "Lead Generation" (not "Phase 1")
    - "Technical Implementation" (not "Dev Stuff")
    - "Quality Assurance" (not "Testing")

    **Why It Matters:**
    Clear names help users find activities quickly without referring to documentation.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Be Consistent Across Processes">
    **Example: Use "Discovery" Everywhere**
    - Sales Process: "Discovery"
    - Product Development: "Discovery"
    - Customer Success: "Discovery"

    **Why It Matters:**
    Consistency helps users transfer knowledge between processes and reduces cognitive load.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Action-Oriented Language When Appropriate">
    **Good Examples:**
    - "Qualifying Leads" (not "Qualification")
    - "Building Features" (not "Build Phase")
    - "Launching to Market" (not "Launch")

    **Why It Matters:**
    Active language makes the work feel more tangible and actionable.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Keep Names Concise">
    **Good Examples:**
    - "Onboarding" (not "Customer Onboarding and Initial Setup")
    - "Testing" (not "Quality Assurance and Validation Testing")

    **Why It Matters:**
    Short names are easier to scan and work better in UI elements.

    **Exception:** Add detail when disambiguation is needed
    - "Technical Onboarding" vs "Business Onboarding"
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Activity Organization

### How Many Activities?

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Simple Process" icon="list">
    **5-15 activities**

    Perfect for straightforward workflows that one person or team executes.

    Example: Expense reimbursement
  </Card>

  <Card title="Moderate Process" icon="list-ol">
    **15-30 activities**

    Good for cross-functional processes with clear stages.

    Example: Employee onboarding
  </Card>

  <Card title="Complex Process" icon="diagram-project">
    **30-50 activities**

    Large processes with multiple phases and many participants.

    Example: Product development lifecycle
  </Card>

  <Card title="Enterprise Process" icon="building">
    **50+ activities**

    Enterprise-wide processes spanning multiple departments and systems.

    Example: M&A integration process

    **Tip:** Consider breaking into sub-processes
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Warning>
If your process has more than 50 activities, strongly consider breaking it into multiple related processes. Large processes are hard to understand and maintain.
</Warning>

### Activity Granularity

**Too Granular (Bad):**
```
1. Open email client
2. Click "New Email"
3. Enter recipient email address
4. Enter subject line
5. Type message
6. Click Send button
```

**Too Vague (Bad):**
```
1. Communicate with customer
```

**Just Right (Good):**
```
1. Send welcome email to customer with onboarding materials
```

<Tip>
**Rule of Thumb:** Each activity should represent a meaningful unit of work that takes 15 minutes to 4 hours. If it's shorter, consider combining activities. If it's longer, consider breaking it down.
</Tip>

### Activity Naming Conventions

Use consistent verb + noun structure:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Action Verbs">
    **Use strong, specific verbs:**

    **Good:**
    - Review proposal with legal team
    - Conduct customer interview
    - Analyze sales data
    - Create budget forecast
    - Approve purchase requisition

    **Avoid:**
    - Do proposal stuff
    - Handle customer
    - Look at data
    - Budget things
    - Check requisition
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Be Specific">
    **Add context for clarity:**

    **Vague:**
    - Send email
    - Schedule meeting
    - Create document

    **Specific:**
    - Send proposal email to decision maker
    - Schedule kickoff meeting with project team
    - Create technical requirements document

    **Why:** Specificity reduces ambiguity and helps people know exactly what to do.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Include Outcomes When Helpful">
    **Sometimes the "why" matters:**

    **Basic:**
    - Review contract

    **With Outcome:**
    - Review contract for legal compliance

    **When to Add Outcomes:**
    - Complex activities
    - Activities where the purpose isn't obvious
    - Activities with quality criteria
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Consistent Length">
    **Keep activity names similar in length:**

    **Inconsistent:**
    - Call
    - Send comprehensive proposal document to all stakeholders
    - Review
    - Conduct detailed technical architecture planning session

    **Consistent:**
    - Call prospect to qualify need
    - Send proposal to stakeholders
    - Review contract terms
    - Plan technical architecture

    **Why:** Makes scanning easier and looks more professional.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## When to Split Processes

### Signs You Need Multiple Processes

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Different Owners">
    **Indicator:** Two distinct parts of the work have different process owners

    **Example:**
    - "Sales Process" (Owner: VP Sales)
    - "Order Fulfillment Process" (Owner: VP Operations)

    **Why Split:** Different owners means different accountability and likely different teams executing the work.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Different Cadences">
    **Indicator:** Parts of the process run on different schedules

    **Example:**
    - "Product Planning" (Quarterly)
    - "Sprint Execution" (Bi-weekly)

    **Why Split:** Different timeframes make it hard to track progress holistically.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Different Stakeholder Groups">
    **Indicator:** Different groups of people care about different parts

    **Example:**
    - "Sales Qualification" (Sales team)
    - "Customer Onboarding" (Success team)

    **Why Split:** Each team needs their own view without unnecessary activities from other teams.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Reusable Components">
    **Indicator:** Part of the process is used by multiple other processes

    **Example:**
    - "Contract Approval" is used by Sales, Procurement, Partnerships, Legal

    **Why Split:** Create a reusable sub-process that multiple parent processes can reference.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Process Becomes Unwieldy">
    **Indicator:** More than 50 activities, or process documentation is 20+ pages

    **Example:**
    - Split "Product Development" into:
      - "Product Discovery"
      - "Design & Prototyping"
      - "Engineering & QA"
      - "Product Launch"

    **Why Split:** Easier to understand, document, and improve smaller processes.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### How to Split: The Parent-Child Pattern

When splitting a large process:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Parent Process">
    High-level process showing major phases as activities

    **Example: "Customer Lifecycle"**
    - Lead Generation
    - Sales Process → (links to child process)
    - Customer Onboarding → (links to child process)
    - Ongoing Support → (links to child process)
    - Renewal/Expansion → (links to child process)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create Child Processes">
    Detailed processes for each major phase

    **Example: "Sales Process" (child of Customer Lifecycle)**
    - Contains all detailed sales activities
    - Owned by VP Sales
    - Links back to parent process
  </Step>

  <Step title="Link Them Together">
    Use clear references and links between parent and child processes

    **In Parent Process:**
    "For detailed sales activities, see the Sales Process"

    **In Child Process:**
    "This process is part of the Customer Lifecycle"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Define Handoffs">
    Clearly specify how work transfers between processes

    **Example:**
    - Sales Process outputs: Signed contract, customer info
    - Customer Onboarding inputs: Signed contract, customer info
    - Handoff activity: "Transfer account to Customer Success"
  </Step>
</Steps>

## When to Combine Processes

### Signs You Should Combine

<Tip>
Sometimes you'll find multiple small processes that should be combined into one.
</Tip>

**Combine when:**

1. **Same Owner & Team**
   - If the same person/team executes both processes, consider combining
   - Exception: If the processes run at different times/cadences

2. **Tightly Coupled**
   - Process B always starts immediately when Process A ends
   - No other processes can happen between them
   - Same stakeholders involved in both

3. **Too Many Tiny Processes**
   - You have 10+ processes with only 3-5 activities each
   - Creates management overhead
   - Hard to see the big picture

4. **Artificial Splits**
   - Processes were split for no good reason
   - Split doesn't reflect how work actually flows
   - Users constantly need to reference both processes

<Warning>
Don't combine processes just to reduce the total number. Each process should represent a meaningful unit of work with clear purpose and ownership.
</Warning>

## Organizing for Different User Types

Consider how different roles will use the process:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Executors">

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Organizing for the Software, Not the User">
    **Mistake:** Organizing categories based on how the software works rather than how users think

    **Example:**
    - "Database Activities"
    - "API Activities"
    - "UI Activities"

    **Better:**
    - "Account Setup"
    - "User Training"
    - "Go-Live Support"

    **Fix:** Think about the user's mental model, not technical implementation.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Too Many Categories">
    **Mistake:** Creating a category for every 2-3 activities

    **Example:** Process with 15 activities split into 10 categories

    **Better:** 3-5 well-defined categories with multiple activities each

    **Fix:** Each category should represent a meaningful phase or theme with at least 3-5 activities.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Inconsistent Abstraction Levels">
    **Mistake:** Mixing high-level and detailed activities in the same process

    **Example:**
    1. Conduct market research (high-level)
    2. Open Excel (too detailed)
    3. Create go-to-market strategy (high-level)
    4. Click Save button (too detailed)

    **Fix:** Keep all activities at the same level of abstraction.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Missing Handoffs">
    **Mistake:** Process ends but doesn't specify what happens next

    **Example:** Sales process ends with "Close Deal" but doesn't mention handoff to Customer Success

    **Fix:** Final activity should be the handoff to the next process or clear end state.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Organizing Alphabetically">
    **Mistake:** Sorting activities alphabetically for "tidiness"

    **Example:**
    1. Approve budget
    2. Close deal
    3. Demo product
    4. Qualify lead

    **Fix:** Always organize in the order activities are performed, not alphabetically.
  </Accordion>
