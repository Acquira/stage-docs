Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) turn your processes from theoretical frameworks into measurable business outcomes. Learn how to select KPIs that actually matter and drive improvement.

## What Makes a Good KPI?

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Actionable" icon="bolt">
    You can influence the metric through actions you control

    **Bad:** Market conditions
    **Good:** Sales conversion rate
  </Card>

  <Card title="Simple" icon="lightbulb">
    Anyone on the team can understand what it measures

    **Bad:** Weighted pipeline velocity coefficient
    **Good:** Average days to close a deal
  </Card>

  <Card title="Measurable" icon="ruler">
    You can track it consistently with available data

    **Bad:** Customer happiness (subjective)
    **Good:** Net Promoter Score (standardized)
  </Card>

  <Card title="Relevant" icon="bullseye">
    Directly connects to business outcomes that matter

    **Bad:** Number of meetings held
    **Good:** Revenue generated per customer
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## The SMART Framework

Every KPI should be **SMART**:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Specific">
    **Vague:** "Improve customer satisfaction"
    **Specific:** "Increase customer satisfaction score from 7.5 to 8.5"

    Be precise about what you're measuring and what constitutes success.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Measurable">
    **Not Measurable:** "Customers should be happier"
    **Measurable:** "Customer satisfaction score measured via monthly survey"

    Define exactly how you'll collect and calculate the metric.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Achievable">
    **Unrealistic:** "100% customer satisfaction"
    **Achievable:** "85% of customers rate us 4 or 5 stars"

    Set targets that stretch the team but remain possible.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Relevant">
    **Irrelevant:** "Number of social media posts" (for a B2B enterprise sales team)
    **Relevant:** "Number of qualified leads generated" (directly impacts sales)

    Ensure the KPI connects to actual business goals.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Time-Bound">
    **No Timeline:** "Reduce customer churn"
    **Time-Bound:** "Reduce customer churn from 5% to 3% by Q4"

    Specify when you'll measure progress and achieve the target.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
If you can't explain why a KPI matters in one sentence, it's probably not the right KPI.

## KPI Categories

### Input Metrics

**What They Measure:** Activities and resources invested

**Examples:**
- Number of sales calls made
- Hours spent in customer meetings
- Marketing budget allocated
- Training hours completed

**When to Use:**
- To ensure activities are happening
- To measure team capacity
- To track resource utilization

<Warning>
Input metrics alone don't show results. Always pair with output or outcome metrics.
</Warning>

---

### Output Metrics

**What They Measure:** Direct results of activities

**Examples:**
- Number of qualified leads generated
- Features shipped per sprint
- Support tickets resolved
- Proposals sent

**When to Use:**
- To measure productivity
- To track process throughput
- To identify bottlenecks

<Note>
Output metrics show what you produced, but not whether it created business value.
</Note>

---

### Outcome Metrics

**What They Measure:** Business impact and value created

**Examples:**
- Revenue generated
- Customer retention rate
- Net Promoter Score
- Market share gained

**When to Use:**
- To measure business results
- To demonstrate ROI
- To align teams with company goals

<Tip>
Outcome metrics are the most important. They show whether your work actually matters to the business.
</Tip>

---

### Leading Indicators

**What They Measure:** Future performance predictors

**Examples:**
- Pipeline value (predicts future revenue)
- Trial sign-ups (predicts conversions)
- Product engagement (predicts retention)
- Employee satisfaction (predicts turnover)

**When to Use:**
- To forecast future results
- To catch problems early
- To make proactive improvements

---

### Lagging Indicators

**What They Measure:** Historical performance

**Examples:**
- Actual revenue
- Customer churn rate
- Time to hire
- Support ticket backlog

**When to Use:**
- To evaluate past performance
- To measure final outcomes
- To calculate ROI

<Tip>
Use both leading and lagging indicators. Leading indicators help you steer; lagging indicators show where you ended up.

</Warning>

## Setting KPI Targets

### Methods for Setting Targets

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Historical Performance">
    **Method:** Base targets on past performance

    **Example:**
    - Historical win rate: 25%
    - Target: 28% (12% improvement)

    **When to Use:**
    - You have at least 6-12 months of historical data
    - Process is relatively stable
    - No major changes planned

    **Pros:** Realistic and achievable
    **Cons:** May not push team hard enough
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Industry Benchmarks">
    **Method:** Compare to industry standards

    **Example:**
    - Industry average NPS: 30
    - Your current NPS: 25
    - Target: 35 (beat industry average)

    **When to Use:**
    - Reliable benchmark data available
    - You're in a competitive market
    - Want to match/exceed competitors

    **Pros:** External validation of targets
    **Cons:** May not account for your specific context

    <Note>
    Find benchmarks from: Industry reports, consulting firms (Gartner, Forrester), trade associations, public company disclosures
    </Note>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Business Requirements">
    **Method:** Work backward from business goals

    **Example:**
    - Business goal: $10M revenue
    - Average deal size: $50K
    - Deals needed: 200
    - Win rate: 30%
    - Opportunities needed: 667

    **When to Use:**
    - Clear business objectives exist
    - You need to justify headcount/budget
    - Strategic initiatives drive targets

    **Pros:** Aligned with business needs
    **Cons:** May be unrealistic if too aggressive
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Stretch Goals">
    **Method:** Set aggressive targets to drive innovation

    **Example:**
    - Current cycle time: 45 days
    - Stretch target: 30 days (33% improvement)

    **When to Use:**
    - Need breakthrough improvement
    - Team is comfortable with risk
    - Resources available to support ambitious goal

    **Pros:** Drives innovation and creative thinking
    **Cons:** Can demotivate if too unrealistic

    <Warning>
    Stretch goals should be aspirational but not impossible. If the team believes it's unachievable, they won't try.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Target Setting Framework

<Steps>
  <Step title="Establish Baseline">
    Measure current performance for at least one full cycle

    **Example:** Measure win rate for full quarter to establish 25% baseline
  </Step>

  <Step title="Understand Constraints">
    Identify factors that limit improvement

    **Examples:**
    - Budget constraints
    - Team capacity
    - Market conditions
    - Technical limitations
  </Step>

  <Step title="Define Improvement Range">
    **Conservative:** 5-10% improvement
    **Moderate:** 10-20% improvement
    **Aggressive:** 20%+ improvement

    Choose based on resources and urgency
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Targets with Ranges">
    **Minimum Acceptable:** Must achieve
    **Target:** What you're aiming for
    **Stretch:** Aspirational goal

    **Example:**
    - Minimum: 26% win rate
    - Target: 28% win rate
    - Stretch: 30% win rate
  </Step>

  <Step title="Build Action Plans">
    Don't just set targets - define how you'll achieve them

    **For 28% win rate target:**
    - Improve qualification (eliminate poor-fit prospects)
    - Enhance proposal quality (templates + training)
    - Better competitive positioning (win/loss analysis)
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Avoiding Vanity Metrics

**Vanity Metrics:** Numbers that look impressive but don't drive business decisions

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Vanity Metrics">
    ### Common Vanity Metrics

    **Total Website Visitors**
    - Problem: Doesn't show if visitors are qualified
    - Better: Qualified lead conversion rate

    **Total Social Media Followers**
    - Problem: Doesn't show engagement or business impact
    - Better: Social media-sourced leads or revenue

    **Total Features Shipped**
    - Problem: Doesn't show if features are valuable
    - Better: Feature adoption rate or user satisfaction

    **Number of Meetings Held**
    - Problem: Meetings aren't outcomes
    - Better: Decisions made or deals advanced

    **Email Subscribers**
    - Problem: Many may be inactive
    - Better: Engaged subscribers (opened in last 30 days)

    **Lines of Code Written**
    - Problem: More code isn't better
    - Better: Features deployed or bugs fixed
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Better Alternatives">
    ### How to Fix Vanity Metrics

    **Add Context:**
    Instead of "10,000 website visitors"
    Use "10,000 website visitors → 500 trials → 50 customers"

    **Measure Efficiency:**
    Instead of "Sent 1,000 emails"
    Use "Sent 1,000 emails with 25% open rate and 5% click rate"

    **Focus on Outcomes:**
    Instead of "Launched 20 features"
    Use "Launched 20 features → 15 have >10% adoption → $500K ARR impact"

    **Track Quality:**
    Instead of "Closed 100 tickets"
    Use "Closed 100 tickets with 4.8/5 satisfaction and 5% reopen rate"

    **Include Cost:**
    Instead of "Generated 1,000 leads"
    Use "Generated 1,000 leads at $50 cost per lead"
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Tip>
Ask: "If this number goes up, does the business actually improve?" If the answer isn't clearly yes, it's probably a vanity metric.
</Tip>

## Common KPI Mistakes

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Tracking Too Many KPIs">
    **Problem:** Measuring 20+ metrics dilutes focus

    **Result:**
    - Team doesn't know what matters most
    - Analysis paralysis
    - Conflicting priorities

    **Fix:**
    - Choose 3-5 primary KPIs
    - Track others as secondary metrics
    - Review and prune regularly
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Gaming the Metrics">
    **Problem:** Optimizing for the metric instead of the outcome

    **Example:**
    - KPI: Reduce support ticket volume
    - Gaming: Make it harder to submit tickets
    - Result: Fewer tickets but unhappy customers

    **Fix:**
    - Balance metrics (ticket volume + satisfaction score)
    - Measure outcomes, not just activities
    - Review for unintended consequences
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Never Reviewing or Updating KPIs">
    **Problem:** Using the same KPIs regardless of business changes

    **Example:**
    - Startup growth stage: Track customer acquisition
    - Mature company: Still only tracking acquisition (should add retention, NRR)

    **Fix:**
    - Review KPI relevance quarterly
    - Adjust as business priorities evolve
    - Archive metrics that no longer matter
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Measuring Activity, Not Outcomes">
    **Problem:** Tracking what people do, not what they achieve

    **Examples:**
    - Number of calls made (activity)
    - Number of hours worked (activity)
    - Number of features developed (activity)

    **Fix:**
    - Number of deals closed (outcome)
    - Revenue generated (outcome)
    - User satisfaction improved (outcome)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="No Action Plans">
    **Problem:** Measuring metrics without plans to improve them

    **Result:**
    - Numbers reported but nothing changes
    - Metrics become scorecard, not tools
    - Team sees KPIs as bureaucracy

    **Fix:**
    - Every KPI needs an improvement owner
    - Define specific actions to move metrics
    - Celebrate improvements and learn from declines
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Comparing Apples to Oranges">
    **Problem:** Comparing metrics across different contexts

    **Examples:**
    - Enterprise sales cycle vs SMB sales cycle
    - Experienced rep performance vs new rep
    - Q4 holiday season vs Q1 slow season

    **Fix:**
    - Segment metrics by relevant factors
    - Use cohort analysis for fair comparison
    - Account for seasonality and context
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## KPI Selection Checklist

When choosing a KPI, verify:

**Relevance**
* Directly relates to a business goal
* Team can influence this metric
* Matters to executive leadership
* Will drive meaningful decisions

**Measurability**
* Data is available to track it
* Calculation method is clear
* Can be measured consistently
* Automated reporting is possible (or manual is sustainable)

**Quality**
* Passes the SMART test
* Not a vanity metric
* Not easily gamed
* Provides actionable insights

**Practicality**
* Easy to understand and explain
* Fits within total KPI count (3-5 primary)
* Review cadence is defined
* Owner is assigned

<Tip>
If a proposed KPI doesn't check all these boxes, keep refining or choose a different metric.
</Tip>

## Example KPI Dashboard
