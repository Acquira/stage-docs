RACI is a powerful tool for clarifying who does what in your processes. Learn how to use RACI effectively to eliminate confusion, reduce bottlenecks, and improve accountability.

## What is RACI?

RACI is an acronym that defines four types of participation in activities:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Responsible (R)" icon="person-digging">
    **Does the work**

    The person(s) who actually perform the activity. They execute the task and complete the work.

    **Example:** Engineer writes the code
  </Card>

  <Card title="Accountable (A)" icon="circle-check">
    **Owns the outcome**

    The one person ultimately answerable for the activity being completed correctly. They have final decision-making authority.

    **Example:** Engineering Lead owns delivery
  </Card>

  <Card title="Consulted (C)" icon="comments">
    **Provides input**

    People whose opinions are sought before decisions or actions are taken. Two-way communication.

    **Example:** Designer provides UI feedback
  </Card>

  <Card title="Informed (I)" icon="envelope">
    **Kept in the loop**

    People who need to know about decisions or actions after they happen. One-way communication.

    **Example:** VP Engineering gets status updates
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## The Golden Rules

<Warning>
**Rule #1: One and only one Accountable person per activity**

Every activity must have exactly one Accountable person. Multiple Accountable people creates confusion about who truly owns the outcome.
</Warning>

<Tip>
**Rule #2: Accountable doesn't mean they do all the work**

The Accountable person ensures work gets done, but may delegate execution to Responsible parties. Think of Accountable as the "owner" and Responsible as the "doer."
</Tip>

<Note>
**Rule #3: Consulted and Informed are optional**

Not every activity needs consultation or notification. Only add these roles when truly necessary to avoid over-communication.
</Note>

## Common RACI Patterns

### Pattern 1: Solo Execution

**Simple activities where one person does it all**

| Activity | Sales Rep | Sales Manager |
|----------|-----------|---------------|
| Send follow-up email | A, R | I |

- Sales Rep is both Accountable and Responsible
- Manager is just Informed

**When to Use:** Simple tasks that don't require collaboration

---

### Pattern 2: Manager + Executor

**Most common pattern for team activities**

| Activity | Account Executive | Sales Manager | Legal | Finance |
|----------|-------------------|---------------|-------|---------|
| Negotiate contract | R | A | C | I |

- AE does the work (Responsible)
- Manager owns the outcome (Accountable)
- Legal provides input (Consulted)
- Finance is kept informed (Informed)

**When to Use:** Activities where a manager oversees team member execution

---

### Pattern 3: Cross-Functional Collaboration

**Multiple people contribute to the work**

| Activity | Developer 1 | Developer 2 | Engineering Lead | Designer |
|----------|-------------|-------------|------------------|----------|
| Build dashboard feature | R | R | A | C |

- Two developers share execution (both Responsible)
- Lead owns delivery (Accountable)
- Designer provides input (Consulted)

**When to Use:** Activities requiring collaboration between multiple contributors

---

### Pattern 4: Expert Consultation

**Subject matter expert provides critical input**

| Activity | PM | Designer | Eng Lead | Legal | Security |
|----------|-----|----------|----------|-------|----------|
| Design user permissions | R | R | C | C | C |

- PM and Designer do the work (Responsible)
- PM owns the outcome (Accountable)
- Multiple experts consulted (Legal for compliance, Security for vulnerabilities, Engineering for feasibility)

**When to Use:** Activities requiring specialized expertise or approval

## How to Assign RACI Effectively

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start with Accountable">
    Ask: "Who is ultimately responsible if this activity fails or succeeds?"

    This should be the person with decision-making authority for the activity.

    **Example:** For "Approve budget," the Department Head is Accountable
  </Step>

  <Step title="Identify Responsible">
    Ask: "Who actually does the work?"

    These are the people executing the activity day-to-day.

    **Example:** For "Approve budget," the Budget Analyst prepares the analysis (Responsible), but Department Head makes final call (Accountable)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Determine Consulted (Sparingly)">
    Ask: "Who must provide input before this activity can be completed?"

    Only include people whose input is genuinely required, not nice-to-have.

    **Example:** For "Approve budget," Finance and VP must be Consulted
  </Step>

  <Step title="Identify Informed (Minimally)">
    Ask: "Who needs to know this was completed?"

    Only include people who truly need notification. Too many Informed parties creates email fatigue.

    **Example:** For "Approve budget," the CFO is Informed
  </Step>

  <Step title="Validate No Gaps">
    Ensure every activity has:
    - Exactly one Accountable (A)
    - At least one Responsible (R)
    - Consulted and Informed as needed (optional)

    **Red Flags:**
    - No Accountable → No ownership
    - Multiple Accountable → Confusion
    - No Responsible → No one to do the work
  </Step>
</Steps>

## RACI by Role Type

### Individual Contributors

**Typical Assignments:**
- **Responsible:** Most of the time for their work
- **Accountable:** For simple, independent tasks
- **Consulted:** When they have specialized expertise
- **Informed:** When they're affected by outcomes

**Example: Software Engineer**
- **A, R:** Write unit tests for their code
- **R:** Implement new feature (Engineering Lead is A)
- **C:** Provide input on technical architecture
- **I:** Notified when product requirements change

---

### Team Leads / Managers

**Typical Assignments:**
- **Accountable:** For most activities their team executes
- **Responsible:** For management activities (reviews, approvals)
- **Consulted:** By other teams on cross-functional work
- **Informed:** On executive decisions affecting their team

**Example: Engineering Manager**
- **A:** Feature delivery (engineers are R)
- **R, A:** Conduct code reviews and approvals
- **C:** Consulted on product roadmap decisions
- **I:** Informed when company strategy changes

---

### Executives

**Typical Assignments:**
- **Accountable:** For strategic, high-stakes decisions
- **Responsible:** Rarely (they delegate execution)
- **Consulted:** On major initiatives and decisions
- **Informed:** On significant outcomes and metrics

**Example: VP of Sales**
- **A:** Approve pricing for large deals (Sales Manager is R)
- **R, A:** Set quarterly sales targets
- **C:** Consulted on product pricing strategy
- **I:** Informed of all closed deals

---

### Support Roles (Legal, Finance, HR)

**Typical Assignments:**
- **Consulted:** Most common - provide expertise
- **Accountable:** For activities in their domain
- **Informed:** When their expertise area is affected
- **Responsible:** For specialized tasks

**Example: Legal Counsel**
- **C:** Consulted on all contracts and agreements
- **A, R:** Draft and approve legal policies
- **I:** Informed of potential legal issues
- **R:** Review marketing claims for compliance (Marketing is A)

## Common RACI Mistakes

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Mistake #1: Multiple Accountable People">
    **The Problem:**
    Two or more people marked as Accountable creates confusion about who truly owns the decision.

    **Bad Example:**
    | Activity | PM | Engineering Lead |
    |----------|-----|------------------|
    | Define feature requirements | A | A |

    **Why It's Bad:**
    When the feature fails, who is responsible? When there's a disagreement, who decides?

    **The Fix:**
    Pick one person as Accountable. If you can't decide, the activity is poorly defined.

    **Good Example:**
    | Activity | PM | Engineering Lead |
    |----------|-----|------------------|
    | Define feature requirements | A | C |
    | Implement feature | C | A |

    PM owns what gets built, Engineering Lead owns how it's built.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Mistake #2: Everyone is Consulted">
    **The Problem:**
    Too many people in the Consulted role slows down execution and creates consensus paralysis.

    **Bad Example:**
    | Activity | PM | Designer | Eng Lead | Sales | Marketing | Support | Finance | Legal |
    |----------|-----|----------|----------|-------|-----------|---------|---------|-------|
    | Choose button color | A, R | C | C | C | C | C | C | C |

    **Why It's Bad:**
    Getting 7 people's opinions on a minor decision is inefficient and delays work.

    **The Fix:**
    Only consult people who have truly necessary expertise or decision-making authority.

    **Good Example:**
    | Activity | PM | Designer | Eng Lead |
    |----------|-----|----------|----------|
    | Choose button color | C | A, R | I |

    Designer makes the decision (they're the expert), PM provides input, Engineering is just informed.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Mistake #3: Confusing Accountable and Responsible">
    **The Problem:**
    Marking the person doing the work as Accountable when their manager should own the outcome.

    **Bad Example:**
    | Activity | Junior Developer | Engineering Manager |
    |----------|------------------|---------------------|
    | Build payment integration | A, R | I |

    **Why It's Bad:**
    Junior developer doesn't have authority to make decisions or handle issues if something goes wrong.

    **The Fix:**
    Manager is Accountable for outcomes their team produces, team member is Responsible for execution.

    **Good Example:**
    | Activity | Junior Developer | Engineering Manager |
    |----------|------------------|---------------------|
    | Build payment integration | R | A |

    Manager owns the delivery, developer does the work. If issues arise, manager has authority to address them.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Mistake #4: Informed Overload">
    **The Problem:**
    Too many people marked as Informed creates notification fatigue.

    **Bad Example:**
    Every activity has 10+ people marked as Informed, resulting in hundreds of notifications daily.

    **Why It's Bad:**
    People start ignoring notifications when overwhelmed, missing truly important updates.

    **The Fix:**
    Only mark people as Informed when they truly need to know. Ask: "What will this person do with this information?"

    **Guidelines:**
    - Direct manager: Usually Informed
    - Skip-level manager: Only for significant activities
    - Peer teams: Only if it affects their work
    - Executive team: Only for high-stakes activities
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Mistake #5: No RACI at All">
    **The Problem:**
    Defining activities without clarifying who does what.

    **Result:**
    - "I thought you were doing that?"
    - Work falls through the cracks
    - Duplication of effort
    - Unclear accountability

    **The Fix:**
    Every activity must have RACI assignments. If you can't assign RACI, the activity is poorly defined.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Mistake #6: RACI by Job Title Instead of Role">
    **The Problem:**
    Assigning RACI to titles (e.g., "Manager") rather than specific people or roles in context.

    **Bad Example:**
    "All managers are Accountable"

    **Why It's Bad:**
    Which manager? If you have multiple managers, this creates the multiple-Accountable problem.

    **The Fix:**
    Assign RACI to specific roles in the process context.

    **Good Example:**
    "Hiring Manager is Accountable" (clear role in this specific process)
  </Accordion>

## RACI Decision Tree

Use this flowchart to determine RACI assignments:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Is this person making the final decision?">
    **YES** → They are **Accountable (A)**

    **NO** → Go to next question
  </Step>

  <Step title="Is this person doing the actual work?">
    **YES** → They are **Responsible (R)**

    **NO** → Go to next question
  </Step>

  <Step title="Must you get their input before proceeding?">
    **YES** → They are **Consulted (C)**

    **NO** → Go to next question
  </Step>

  <Step title="Do they need to know the outcome?">
    **YES** → They are **Informed (I)**

    **NO** → They don't need a RACI assignment for this activity
  </Step>
</Steps>

## RACI Templates by Process Type

### Sales Process RACI

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Prospecting">
    | Activity | SDR | Sales Manager | Marketing |
    |----------|-----|---------------|-----------|
    | Research target accounts | A, R | I | I |
    | Initial outreach | A, R | I | I |
    | Discovery call | A, R | I | I |
    | Lead qualification | R | A | I |
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Closing">
    | Activity | AE | Sales Manager | Legal | Finance |
    |----------|-----|---------------|-------|---------|
    | Create proposal | A, R | I | - | - |
    | Negotiate pricing | R | A | - | C |
    | Draft contract | R | C | A | I |
    | Close deal | A, R | I | I | I |
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Project Management RACI

| Activity | PM | Developer | Designer | Stakeholder |
|----------|-----|-----------|----------|-------------|
| Define requirements | A, R | C | C | C |
| Create designs | C | I | A, R | I |
| Develop features | C | A, R | I | I |
| Test and QA | R | C | I | I |
| Launch project | A | R | R | I |

### HR Process RACI

| Activity | Recruiter | Hiring Manager | HR Business Partner | Candidate |
|----------|-----------|----------------|---------------------|-----------|
| Post job opening | A, R | C | I | - |
| Screen resumes | A, R | C | I | - |
| Conduct interviews | C | A, R | I | R |
| Make offer decision | C | A | C | - |
| Extend offer | R | R | A | - |

## Advanced RACI Concepts

### RACI-VS (Adding Verifier and Signatory)

Some organizations add two more roles:

- **V (Verifier):** Checks the work meets acceptance criteria
- **S (Signatory):** Provides formal approval/signature

**When to Use:** Highly regulated industries or processes requiring formal approval chains

**Example:**
| Activity | Engineer | QA | Manager | Legal |
|----------|----------|-----|---------|-------|
| Update privacy policy | R | V | A | S |

---

### RACI for Automated Activities

**Question:** How do you assign RACI when an activity is automated?

**Answer:** Focus on who's accountable if the automation fails

**Example:**
| Activity | System | DevOps | Sales Manager |
|----------|---------|--------|---------------|
| Send welcome email (automated) | R | A | I |

- System does the work (R)
- DevOps owns the automation (A)
- Sales Manager is notified (I)

---

### RACI for Committee Decisions

**Question:** What if a committee makes decisions?

**Answer:** One person in the committee is Accountable for the final call

**Example:**
| Activity | Committee Chair | Committee Members | Requestor |
|----------|-----------------|-------------------|-----------|
| Approve budget request | A | C | R, I |

- Chair makes final decision (A)
- Members provide input (C)
- Requestor presents case (R) and is informed of decision (I)

## Testing Your RACI

Use these questions to validate your RACI assignments:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="The Authority Test">
    **Ask:** "Does the Accountable person have authority to make decisions about this activity?"

    If NO: Reassign Accountable to someone with decision-making power.

    **Example:**
    Bad: Junior intern is Accountable for budget approval
    Good: Department head is Accountable for budget approval
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="The Failure Test">
    **Ask:** "If this activity fails, who gets in trouble?"

    That person should be Accountable.

    **Example:**
    If a marketing campaign flops, the Marketing Manager is accountable (not the designer who created assets).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="The Bottleneck Test">
    **Ask:** "Are there too many Consulted people slowing things down?"

    If YES: Remove Consulted roles that aren't truly necessary. Move them to Informed.

    **Rule of Thumb:** More than 3 Consulted people is usually too many.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="The Communication Test">
    **Ask:** "Will every Informed person actually read these notifications?"

    If NO: Remove Informed assignments that create noise.

    **Guideline:** If someone is Informed on more than 50 activities, they'll start ignoring notifications.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="The Gap Test">
    **Ask:** "Does every activity have exactly one Accountable and at least one Responsible?"

    If NO: Fix the gaps before proceeding.

    **Red Flags:**
    - Activity with no Accountable = No ownership
    - Activity with no Responsible = No execution
    - Activity with multiple Accountable = Confusion
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## RACI Implementation Checklist

When adding RACI to your processes:

**Planning Phase**
- [ ] Identify all roles that interact with this process
- [ ] Define what each role title means in your organization
- [ ] Review organizational chart for reporting structures
- [ ] Understand decision-making authority at each level

**Assignment Phase**
- [ ] Assign exactly one Accountable per activity
- [ ] Assign at least one Responsible per activity
- [ ] Only add Consulted when input is truly required
- [ ] Only add Informed when notification is truly needed
- [ ] Document why each RACI assignment was made

**Review Phase**
- [ ] Review with process participants for accuracy
- [ ] Test authority levels (does Accountable have power?)
- [ ] Check for bottlenecks (too many Consulted?)
- [ ] Validate communication load (too many Informed?)
- [ ] Get sign-off from all Accountable parties

**Maintenance Phase**
- [ ] Review RACI quarterly or when roles change
- [ ] Update when org structure changes
- [ ] Gather feedback from participants
- [ ] Adjust based on bottlenecks or confusion

<Tip>
Schedule a RACI review session with your team. Walk through each activity and discuss who should be assigned to each role. Consensus at the start prevents confusion later.
</Tip>

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Content Publishing

| Activity | Content Writer | Editor | Legal | Marketing Manager |
|----------|---------------|--------|-------|-------------------|
| Draft article | A, R | - | - | I |
| Edit for quality | I | A, R | - | I |
| Review for legal compliance | I | C | A, R | I |
| Publish to website | R | C | I | A |

**Why This Works:**
- Writer owns the draft
- Editor owns the quality
- Legal owns compliance
- Marketing Manager owns publication decision
- Clear handoffs between stages

---

### Example 2: Software Deployment

| Activity | Developer | QA | DevOps | Engineering Manager | Product Manager |
|----------|-----------|-----|--------|---------------------|-----------------|
| Code review | R | - | - | A | I |
| QA testing | C | A, R | - | I | I |
| Deploy to staging | C | I | A, R | I | I |
| Production approval | C | C | C | A | C |
| Deploy to production | - | I | A, R | I | I |

**Why This Works:**
- Each stage has clear ownership
- Multiple parties consulted for production (high-risk decision)
- Manager makes final call on production deployment
- Appropriate visibility without over-notification
