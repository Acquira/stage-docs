## The Cookie Cutter Analogy

Think of workflow templates and instances like cookie cutters and cookies:

- **Template** = The cookie cutter (reusable pattern)
- **Instance** = The actual cookie (one-time use)

You use the same cookie cutter over and over to make many cookies. Similarly, you use the same workflow template over and over to create many workflow instances.

## Templates vs Instances

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Workflow Template" icon="cookie">
    - Reusable blueprint
    - Contains task definitions
    - Used to create instances
    - Edited by admins only
    - Saved in template library
  </Card>

  <Card title="Workflow Instance" icon="list-check">
    - One-time execution
    - Actual work gets done here
    - Created from a template
    - Assigned to specific people
    - Tracks real progress
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Comparison Table

| Aspect | Template | Instance |
|--------|----------|----------|
| **Purpose** | Blueprint for future work | Actual work execution |
| **Reusability** | Used many times | Used once, then complete |
| **Who Creates** | Admins | System (from template) |
| **Who Uses** | Admins (to create instances) | Team members (to do work) |
| **Changes** | Updates affect future instances | Changes only affect this instance |
| **Example** | "Employee Onboarding" | "Onboarding John Smith - May 2025" |

## Why This Distinction Matters

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Consistency Across Your Team">
    Templates ensure everyone follows the same process. When you onboard 10 employees, all 10 get the exact same steps.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Easy Updates">
    Update the template once, and all future instances automatically use the improved process. You don't have to update every single workflow.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Clear Separation of Roles">
    - **Admins** design and maintain templates
    - **Team members** execute instances

    This keeps your processes organized and prevents accidental changes to your master workflows.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Historical Record">
    Completed instances preserve exactly how work was done, even if the template changes later. This is crucial for audits and compliance.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Real-World Examples

<Steps>
  <Step title="Template: Employee Onboarding">
    Admin creates a workflow template with 15 tasks covering paperwork, equipment setup, training, and introductions.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Instance: Onboarding Sarah Chen">
    When Sarah joins in March, HR creates an instance from the template. Sarah's manager completes the 15 tasks specific to her onboarding.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Instance: Onboarding James Rodriguez">
    When James joins in April, HR creates another instance from the same template. James' manager completes his 15 tasks.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Template Updated">
    Admin adds a new task: "Schedule security training." This task will appear in all future onboarding instances but won't affect Sarah's or James' completed workflows.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Key Takeaways

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Templates" icon="stamp">
    The master copy that never changes unless an admin updates it
  </Card>

  <Card title="Instances" icon="clipboard-list">
    The working copy where actual tasks get completed
  </Card>

  <Card title="Relationship" icon="arrows-split-up-and-left">
    One template creates unlimited instances
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
When you're working on tasks, you're always working in an **instance**. You'll never directly interact with templates unless you're an admin.
