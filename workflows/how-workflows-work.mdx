## What is a Workflow?

A workflow is a series of tasks that must be completed in a specific order to accomplish a business process. Think of it like a recipe: each step builds on the previous one to create the final result.

## The Workflow Lifecycle

<Steps>
  <Step title="Template Created">
    An admin creates a workflow template with all the tasks, dependencies, and assignments defined.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Instance Generated">
    When work needs to be done, an instance is created from the template. This could be triggered by:
    - A business acquisition starting
    - An employee joining
    - A quarterly review cycle
    - Manual creation by an admin
  </Step>

  <Step title="Tasks Become Available">
    Tasks with no dependencies become available immediately. Team members can see and start working on them.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Work Progresses">
    As tasks are completed, dependent tasks unlock and become available. The workflow moves forward step by step.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Workflow Completes">
    When all tasks are marked complete, the workflow automatically moves to "Completed" state.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Historical Record">
    The completed workflow remains in the system as a historical record, including all evidence and timestamps.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Understanding Task Dependencies

Task dependencies control the order in which work gets done. A task can't start until its dependent tasks are finished.

### Dependency Example: Employee Onboarding

```
Task 1: Send offer letter
  ↓
Task 2: Receive signed offer (depends on Task 1)
  ↓
Task 3: Order laptop (depends on Task 2)
  ↓
Task 4: Set up email account (depends on Task 2)
  ↓
Task 5: First day orientation (depends on Tasks 3 & 4)
```

<Info>
When Task 2 is completed, both Task 3 and Task 4 become available at the same time because they both depend only on Task 2.
</Info>

## Task Assignments

Tasks can be assigned in several ways:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Role-Based Assignment" icon="user-group">
    Task assigned to a role like "HR Manager" or "Operations Lead." Whoever holds that role sees the task.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Specific Person" icon="user">
    Task assigned directly to an individual team member by name.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Department Assignment" icon="building">
    Task assigned to an entire department. Anyone in that department can claim or complete it.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Dynamic Assignment" icon="rotate">
    Assignment changes based on context (e.g., "Assigned to the acquisition's Project Manager").
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Workflow States

Every workflow instance is in one of four states:

### Draft

<Accordion title="Draft State">
  - Workflow is being set up but not yet active
  - Tasks are not yet available to team members
  - Admins can still make changes
  - No work is being tracked

  **When you'll see this**: Rarely. Most workflows move directly from template to Active state.
</Accordion>

### Active

<Accordion title="Active State">
  - Workflow is currently running
  - Tasks are available to assigned team members
  - Work is being completed
  - Progress is being tracked

  **When you'll see this**: This is the normal working state. Most of your workflows will be Active.
</Accordion>

### Completed

<Accordion title="Completed State">
  - All tasks have been marked complete
  - Workflow is finished
  - No more work can be done
  - Preserved as historical record

  **When you'll see this**: After you finish all tasks in a workflow, it automatically moves to Completed.
</Accordion>

### Cancelled

<Accordion title="Cancelled State">
  - Workflow was stopped before completion
  - Might be cancelled because it's no longer needed
  - Incomplete tasks remain incomplete
  - Preserved as historical record

  **When you'll see this**: Occasionally, when a project is abandoned or circumstances change (e.g., acquisition falls through).
</Accordion>

## Task States Within Workflows

Individual tasks within a workflow also have states:

| Task State | What It Means |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Pending** | Task exists but dependencies aren't met yet |
| **Available** | Task is ready to be started (all dependencies met) |
| **In Progress** | Someone has started working on the task |
| **Completed** | Task is finished and evidence is uploaded |
| **Blocked** | Task can't proceed due to an issue |

## Workflow Progress Indicators

You can track workflow progress in several ways:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Task Completion %" icon="percent">
    Shows what percentage of tasks are complete (e.g., "7 of 15 tasks complete - 47%")
  </Card>

  <Card title="Visual Progress Bar" icon="chart-bar">
    A progress bar that fills as tasks are completed
  </Card>

  <Card title="Estimated Completion" icon="calendar-clock">
    Based on task due dates and current progress
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## How Tasks Flow Through a Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Task is Created">
    Task exists in "Pending" state, waiting for dependencies.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Dependencies Met">
    All required tasks are complete. Task moves to "Available."
  </Step>

  <Step title="Work Begins">
    Assigned person opens the task and starts working. Task moves to "In Progress."
  </Step>

  <Step title="Work Completed">
    Person uploads evidence and marks task complete. Task moves to "Completed."
  </Step>

  <Step title="Dependent Tasks Unlock">
    Any tasks that depended on this task now become "Available."
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Key Takeaways

<Tip>
**Sequential Flow**: Workflows ensure work happens in the right order through dependencies.
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Clear Assignment**: Every task knows who should do it, eliminating confusion.
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Automatic Progress**: As you complete tasks, the workflow automatically progresses and unlocks the next steps.
</Tip>

<Warning>
You can't complete a task until all its dependencies are finished. This is by design to maintain quality and order.
</Warning>
