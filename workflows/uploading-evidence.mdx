## Why Upload Evidence

Evidence serves as proof that work was completed correctly. It's the digital paper trail that:

    <Note>
    **Placeholder**: Screenshot highlighting the Add Evidence button
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Files from Your Computer">
    Your computer's file browser opens. Select the file(s) you want to upload:

    - You can select multiple files at once
    - Hold Ctrl (Windows) or Cmd (Mac) to select multiple
    - Or drag and drop files directly into the upload area
  </Step>

  <Step title="Wait for Upload to Complete">
    Files upload to the system. You'll see:

    - Upload progress bar for each file
    - File name and size
    - Completion checkmark when done

    </Note>

    <Warning>
    Don't close the browser window or navigate away until all uploads complete.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Description to Each File">
    For each uploaded file, add a descriptive caption:

    **Good Descriptions:**
    - "Signed offer letter - John Smith - Start date June 1, 2025"
    - "Screenshot of sent email to vendor - Order confirmation #12345"
    - "Photo of installed network equipment in server room"

    **Bad Descriptions:**
    - "document.pdf"
    - "screenshot"
    - "IMG_1234.jpg"

    <Tip>
    Write descriptions as if someone who wasn't there will review this evidence in 6 months. What context do they need?
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify Evidence Appears">
    Confirm your evidence files are listed in the task with:
    - Correct file names
    - Clear descriptions
    - Preview thumbnails (for images)

    Press `Print Screen` key to capture entire screen

    Image is copied to clipboard
  </Step>

  <Step title="Paste and Save">
    Open Paint or any image editor

    Press `Ctrl + V` to paste

    Save as PNG file
  </Step>
</Steps>

    Press `Cmd + Shift + 4`, then press `Space`

    Click the window you want to capture
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Screenshot Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Capture the Important Parts">
    Don't screenshot your entire screen if only one part matters. Use area capture to focus on relevant content.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Include Timestamps When Relevant">
    If timing matters, make sure timestamps or dates are visible in the screenshot.

    **Example**: Screenshot of email should show the sent date/time.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Ensure Text is Readable">
    Zoom in if needed before capturing so text is clear and legible.

    Test: Can you read all text in the screenshot without zooming? If not, recapture.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Redact Sensitive Information">
    Before uploading, redact:
    - Social security numbers
    - Full credit card numbers
    - Passwords or API keys
    - Personal health information
    - Other confidential data not needed for the task

    Use a rectangle tool to black out sensitive areas.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Annotations (if helpful)">
    Add arrows, circles, or text to highlight important parts of the screenshot.

    **Tools**:
    - Windows: Snip & Sketch
    - Mac: Preview > Markup
    - Browser extension: Awesome Screenshot
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Adding Comments to Evidence

You can add comments or notes to evidence files to provide context:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click on the Evidence File">
    After uploading, click the evidence file in the task.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click 'Add Comment'">
    Find the comment option for that specific piece of evidence.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Write Your Comment">
    Explain anything important about this evidence:

    **Examples:**
    - "Note the start date changed from May 15 to June 1 per candidate request"
    - "System shows 'active' status which confirms configuration is complete"
    - "Vendor confirmed 3-5 business days for delivery"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save Comment">
    Comment appears with the evidence for future reference.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Organizing Multiple Evidence Files

If you need to upload many files for one task, organize them clearly:

### Use Clear File Names

Before uploading, rename files to be descriptive:

**Good File Names:**
- `01-signed-contract-acme-corp.pdf`
- `02-invoice-payment-confirmation.pdf`
- `03-delivery-receipt.pdf`

**Bad File Names:**
- `document.pdf`
- `scan0001.pdf`
- `IMG_5432.jpg`

### Number Files if Order Matters

Use leading numbers to show sequence:
- `01-before-photo.jpg`
- `02-during-installation.jpg`
- `03-after-completion.jpg`

### Group Related Files

Upload related evidence together, then add a comment explaining how they're related:

**Example:**
```
Uploading 3 files for vendor onboarding:
1. Signed W-9 form
2. Certificate of Insurance
3. Banking information form

All forms collected and verified per checklist.
```

## Evidence File Size Limits

Most systems have file size limits for uploads:

| File Type | Typical Limit | Best Practice |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|
| **Documents** | 10 MB | Compress PDFs if needed |
| **Screenshots** | 5 MB | Use PNG, crop to relevant area |
| **Photos** | 10 MB | Resize large photos before upload |
| **Videos** | 100 MB | Compress or link to cloud storage |

<Tip>
If your file exceeds the limit:
- Compress it using online tools (for PDFs/images)
- Split into multiple smaller files
- Upload to Google Drive/Dropbox and paste the link in comments
</Tip>

## Viewing Uploaded Evidence

After evidence is uploaded, you and others can view it:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Task">
    Navigate to the task with evidence.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Scroll to Evidence Section">
    Find the Evidence or Attachments area.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click a File to Preview">
    Click any evidence file to preview it:

    - Images open in preview viewer
    - PDFs open in browser or download
    - Other files download to your computer

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/workflows/evidence-preview.png" alt="Evidence preview interface" />
    </Frame>

    <Note>
    **Placeholder**: Screenshot showing evidence preview modal
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Download if Needed">
    Click **Download** to save a copy to your computer.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Sometimes you need to update evidence after uploading:

### Adding More Evidence

<Accordion title="To add additional files">
  1. Open the task
  2. Click **Add Evidence** again
  3. Upload new files
  4. Previous evidence remains; new files are added

  You can add as many evidence files as needed.
</Accordion>

### Replacing Evidence

<Accordion title="To replace incorrect evidence">
  1. Upload the corrected file
  2. Add a comment: "Replacing previous file - this version is correct"
  3. Delete the old file (if permissions allow)
  4. Or add comment to old file: "Replaced by [new filename]"
</Accordion>

### Deleting Evidence

<Accordion title="To remove evidence">
  1. Click the evidence file
  2. Click **Delete** or trash icon
  3. Confirm deletion

  <Warning>
  Some systems don't allow evidence deletion after a task is marked complete. This is for audit trail purposes.
  </Warning>
</Accordion>

## Evidence Requirements by Task

Some tasks have specific evidence requirements:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/workflows/evidence-requirements.png" alt="Evidence requirements shown in task" />
</Frame>

<Note>
**Placeholder**: Screenshot showing evidence requirements listed in task details
</Note>

### Required Evidence

<Accordion title="Task requires specific evidence">
  The task details will specify exactly what evidence is needed:

  **Example:**
  ```
  Evidence Required:
  - Screenshot of sent email (showing recipient and timestamp)
  - Copy of the signed form (PDF)
  ```

  You cannot mark the task complete until required evidence is uploaded.
</Accordion>

### Optional Evidence

<Accordion title="Evidence is recommended but not required">
  Task can be marked complete without evidence, but uploading is strongly encouraged.

  **Best Practice**: Always upload evidence even if optional.
</Accordion>

### No Evidence Required

<Accordion title="Some tasks don't require evidence">
  Simple, low-risk tasks may not require evidence:
  - Internal team meetings
  - Simple status updates
  - Quick review tasks

  Even for these, consider uploading evidence to maintain a complete record.
</Accordion>

## Evidence Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Upload Immediately">
    Don't wait. Upload evidence as soon as you complete the work:

    ✅ **Right after completing**: Details are fresh, files are ready

    ❌ **Days later**: You'll forget details, have to recreate evidence, or lose files
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="More Evidence > Less Evidence">
    When in doubt, upload it. Extra evidence is never a problem; missing evidence causes issues.

    **Example**: If you took 3 screenshots during a process, upload all 3 even if only 1 is required.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Think About Future Readers">
    Upload and describe evidence as if someone unfamiliar with the task will need to understand what happened.

    Ask yourself: "Could someone 6 months from now understand what I did based on this evidence?"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Verify Before Marking Complete">
    Before marking a task complete, verify:
    - Evidence clearly shows task completion
    - All required evidence is present
    - Files are readable/viewable
    - Descriptions are clear
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Protect Sensitive Information">
    Be mindful of what you upload:
    - Redact personal/confidential information
    - Don't upload passwords or credentials
    - Follow your company's data security policies
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
