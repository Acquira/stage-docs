## What is Evidence?

Evidence is documentation that proves a task was completed correctly. It's the "receipt" that shows the work was done.

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Documents" icon="file-pdf">
    Signed contracts, completed forms, reports
  </Card>

  <Card title="Screenshots" icon="camera">
    System configurations, email confirmations, completed processes
  </Card>

  <Card title="Photos" icon="image">
    Physical installations, facility inspections, equipment setups
  </Card>

## Why Evidence Matters

### For You (The Task Owner)

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Protects You">
    Evidence proves you completed the work. If someone asks "Was this done?" weeks later, you have documentation to show it was.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Helps You Remember">
    When you need to do similar work in the future, you can reference your previous evidence to remember exactly how you did it.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Shows Your Work">
    Evidence demonstrates the quality and thoroughness of your work to managers and stakeholders.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### For Your Team

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Enables Knowledge Transfer">
    New team members can see exactly how tasks were completed by reviewing evidence from past workflows.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Ensures Consistency">
    Everyone can see the standard of work expected by reviewing evidence from completed tasks.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Facilitates Handoffs">
    When work passes between team members, evidence provides context about what's already been done.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### For the Business

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Compliance & Audits">
    Many business processes require documented proof that steps were completed correctly and on time.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Quality Assurance">
    Managers can review evidence to ensure work meets quality standards without micromanaging.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Process Improvement">
    Reviewing evidence from completed workflows helps identify bottlenecks and opportunities for improvement.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Risk Mitigation">
    If something goes wrong, evidence creates a clear audit trail showing what was done, when, and by whom.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Types of Evidence

Different tasks require different types of evidence. Here's what works best for each scenario:

### Documentation Evidence

<Card title="Best For" icon="file-check">
  Legal agreements, financial transactions, formal approvals, compliance documentation
</Card>

**Examples:**
- Signed offer letter (PDF)
- Completed W-4 form
- Vendor contract with signatures
- Insurance certificate
- Bank statement showing wire transfer

### Screenshot Evidence

<Card title="Best For" icon="camera">
  System configurations, software setups, online confirmations, digital processes
</Card>

**Examples:**
- Email confirmation that account was created
- Screenshot of software license activated
- Configuration screen showing settings were changed
- Order confirmation from vendor website
- System status showing backup completed

### Photo Evidence

<Card title="Best For" icon="image">
  Physical installations, facility inspections, equipment setups, in-person meetings
</Card>

**Examples:**
- Photo of installed equipment
- Facility safety inspection images
- Photo of organized workspace
- Picture of team at first meeting
- Before/after photos of renovation

### Explanatory Evidence

<Card title="Best For" icon="comment">
  Tasks where visual proof isn't possible but explanation is needed
</Card>

**Examples:**
- Written summary of phone call outcome
- Notes from in-person meeting
- Explanation of decision made
- Description of verbal approval received

<Warning>
Text-only explanations should be used sparingly. Whenever possible, include a supporting document, screenshot, or photo along with your explanation.
</Warning>

## The Evidence Review Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Task Completed">
    You finish the work described in the task.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Evidence Uploaded">
    You upload relevant documentation, screenshots, or photos proving completion.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Comments Added">
    You add a brief comment explaining the evidence if needed (e.g., "Signed contract uploaded - start date is June 1st").
  </Step>

  <Step title="Task Marked Complete">
    You mark the task as complete. It now shows as finished in the workflow.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Available for Review">
    Managers, auditors, or other stakeholders can review your evidence at any time.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Archived with Workflow">
    When the workflow completes, all evidence is preserved as a permanent historical record.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Evidence Best Practices

### Do's

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Upload Immediately" icon="bolt">
    Add evidence as soon as you complete the task. Don't wait until the end of the day or week.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Be Specific" icon="bullseye">
    Name files descriptively (e.g., "signed-offer-letter-john-smith.pdf" not "document.pdf").
  </Card>

  <Card title="Include Context" icon="message">
    Add a comment explaining what the evidence shows, especially if it's not obvious.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Verify Quality" icon="magnifying-glass">
    Make sure screenshots are readable and documents are complete before uploading.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Don'ts

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Don't Skip It" icon="ban">
    Even if the task seems minor, upload evidence. It takes 30 seconds and could save hours later.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Don't Upload Irrelevant Files" icon="trash">
    Only upload evidence directly related to the task. Keep it focused.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Don't Use Poor Quality" icon="image-slash">
    Blurry photos and illegible screenshots aren't helpful. Take a moment to get a clear capture.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Don't Include Sensitive Data Unnecessarily" icon="eye-slash">
    Redact personal information (SSNs, passwords, etc.) before uploading if it's not required.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## How Evidence Creates Accountability

Evidence creates a transparent, accountable system where:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Work is Visible">
    Everyone can see what work has been completed and by whom.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Quality is Verifiable">
    Managers can verify work quality without hovering over team members.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Standards are Clear">
    New team members can see the expected standard by reviewing past evidence.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Credit is Given">
    Your contributions are documented and recognized.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Issues are Traceable">
    If problems arise, you can trace back to see where things went off track.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Improvements are Data-Driven">
    Patterns in evidence help identify process improvements.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Without Evidence

> "Did someone contact the vendor about this?"
>
> "I think so... maybe Sarah did it last week?"
>
> "I don't see any email. Can you check?"
>
> *30 minutes of searching ensues*

### With Evidence

> "Did someone contact the vendor about this?"
>
> "Yes, I'll send you the link to the workflow task. Sarah completed it on May 15th and uploaded the vendor's email confirmation."
>
> *5 seconds to find the answer*

## Evidence = Trust + Efficiency

<Tip>
When everyone uploads evidence consistently, your team operates with:
- **Higher trust** (work is proven, not assumed)
- **Greater efficiency** (less time verifying and searching)
- **Better quality** (standards are clear and visible)
- **Stronger accountability** (contributions are documented)
</Tip>
