## How Workflows Are Assigned to You

Workflows can be assigned to you in several ways:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Role Assignment" icon="user-group">
    You receive a workflow because you hold a role (e.g., "Project Manager" or "HR Lead")
  </Card>

  <Card title="Direct Assignment" icon="user-tag">
    An admin or manager directly assigns a specific workflow to you by name
  </Card>

  <Card title="Department Assignment" icon="building">
    Workflow is assigned to your entire department, and you claim it
  </Card>

  <Card title="Auto-Assignment" icon="robot">
    Workflows are automatically assigned based on rules (e.g., when you join a project)
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Finding Your Assigned Workflows

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to My Workflows">
    Click **My Workflows** in the main navigation menu.

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/workflows/my-workflows-nav.png" alt="My Workflows navigation" />
    </Frame>

    <Note>
    **Placeholder**: Screenshot showing My Workflows in navigation menu
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="View Your Workflow List">
    You'll see all workflows currently assigned to you:

    - Active workflows you're working on
    - Not yet started workflows
    - Recently completed workflows

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/workflows/workflow-list.png" alt="Workflow list view" />
    </Frame>

    <Note>
    **Placeholder**: Screenshot of My Workflows list showing multiple workflows
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Filter Your Workflows">
    Use filters to find specific workflows:

    - **Status**: Active, Not Started, Completed
    - **Priority**: High, Medium, Low
    - **Category**: HR, Operations, Finance, Acquisition
    - **Date Range**: Created this week, this month, etc.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Sort Your Workflows">
    Sort by:
    - Due date (urgent first)
    - Priority (high first)
    - Name (alphabetical)
    - Progress (least complete first)
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Understanding Your Workflow List

Each workflow in your list shows key information at a glance:

</Frame>

<Note>
**Placeholder**: Screenshot of a single workflow card with annotations
</Note>

### Workflow Card Details

| Element | What It Shows |
|---------|---------------|
| **Workflow Name** | The name of the workflow (e.g., "Employee Onboarding - Sarah Chen") |
| **Progress Bar** | Visual indicator of completion (e.g., 5 of 15 tasks complete) |
| **Status Badge** | Active, Not Started, or Completed |
| **Priority Indicator** | High, Medium, or Low priority |
| **Due Date** | When the workflow should be completed |
| **Your Task Count** | How many tasks are assigned specifically to you |

## Starting a Workflow Instance

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click on the Workflow">
    From your workflow list, click on the workflow you want to start.

    This opens the workflow detail view.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review Workflow Overview">
    Take a moment to understand the workflow:

    - **Purpose**: What this workflow accomplishes
    - **Total Tasks**: How many tasks are in the workflow
    - **Your Tasks**: Which tasks are assigned to you
    - **Timeline**: Expected completion date
    - **Key Milestones**: Major checkpoints

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/workflows/workflow-overview.png" alt="Workflow overview screen" />
    </Frame>

    <Note>
    **Placeholder**: Screenshot of workflow overview page
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review Task List">
    Scroll down to see all tasks in the workflow:

    - Tasks are listed in order
    - Your tasks are highlighted
    - Task status is shown (Available, Pending, Completed)
    - Dependencies are indicated

    <Tip>
    Look for tasks marked **Available** - these are tasks you can start right now.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start Your First Task">
    Click on an available task to open it and begin work.

    You can only work on tasks that:
    - Are assigned to you
    - Have no incomplete dependencies
    - Haven't been completed yet
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Understanding Your Task List Within a Workflow

When you open a workflow, you'll see all its tasks. Here's how to read the task list:

### Task Status Indicators

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Available" icon="play-circle">
    **Green**: Ready to start. All dependencies are met.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Pending" icon="clock">
    **Gray**: Waiting for dependencies to complete.
  </Card>

  <Card title="In Progress" icon="spinner">
    **Blue**: Currently being worked on by you or a teammate.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Completed" icon="circle-check">
    **Green with checkmark**: Finished with evidence uploaded.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Blocked" icon="ban">
    **Red**: Cannot proceed due to an issue.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Not Your Task" icon="user-slash">
    **Faded**: Assigned to someone else.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Task Assignment Badges

<Accordion title="Your Tasks">
  Tasks assigned to you show **"Assigned to You"** badge prominently. These are your responsibility.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Team Tasks">
  Tasks assigned to your team or department show **"Team Task"** badge. Anyone on the team can claim and complete these.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Other People's Tasks">
  Tasks assigned to others show their name. You can view these but can't complete them.
</Accordion>

### Priority Indicators

Tasks display priority levels that help you decide what to work on first:

- **High Priority**: Red flag - Critical tasks that should be done immediately
- **Medium Priority**: Orange flag - Important tasks with normal urgency
- **Low Priority**: Gray flag - Nice-to-have tasks with flexibility

## Task Dependency Indicators

Dependencies determine when tasks become available. The task list shows dependencies clearly:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/workflows/task-dependencies-view.png" alt="Task dependencies in workflow" />
</Frame>

<Note>
**Placeholder**: Screenshot showing tasks with dependency indicators
</Note>

<Accordion title="No Dependencies">
  Task can be started immediately (if assigned to you).

  Shows: Green **"Ready to Start"** indicator
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Dependencies Met">
  All required tasks are complete. This task is now available.

  Shows: Green **"Available"** indicator
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Waiting on Dependencies">
  Shows which tasks must be completed first.

  Shows: **"Waiting on: Task 3, Task 5"**
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="You're Blocking Others">
  When you expand a task, you can see if other tasks depend on it.

  Shows: **"3 tasks waiting for this to complete"**

  This helps you prioritize - completing this task unblocks teammates.
</Accordion>

## Workflow Progress Tracking

Track overall workflow progress from the workflow overview:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Task Completion %" icon="percent">
    "11 of 20 tasks complete - 55%"
  </Card>

  <Card title="Visual Progress Bar" icon="chart-bar">
    Colored bar showing completion percentage
  </Card>

  <Card title="Estimated Completion" icon="calendar-clock">
    Projected completion date based on current progress
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Progress by Section

Some workflows are organized into sections or phases:

```
Phase 1: Pre-Onboarding (100% complete)
  ✓ Task 1: Send offer letter
  ✓ Task 2: Receive signed offer
  ✓ Task 3: Order equipment

Phase 2: First Day Setup (75% complete)
  ✓ Task 4: Create email account
  ✓ Task 5: Set up workstation
  ⧗ Task 6: Security badge setup

Phase 3: Training (0% complete)
  ⊗ Task 7: Schedule orientation
  ⊗ Task 8: Assign training modules
  ⊗ Task 9: Complete Day 1 training
```

<Info>
Legend:
- ✓ = Complete
- ⧗ = In Progress
- ⊗ = Not Started (dependencies met)
- ⊙ = Pending (waiting on dependencies)
</Info>

## Starting Work on Your First Task

<Steps>
  <Step title="Identify an Available Task">
    Look for tasks marked **Available** and assigned to you.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click the Task">
    Click the task to open its detail view.

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/workflows/task-detail.png" alt="Task detail view" />
    </Frame>

    <Note>
    **Placeholder**: Screenshot of task detail panel
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Read Task Details">
    Review the task carefully:
    - What needs to be done
    - Why it matters
    - How to do it
    - What evidence is required
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click 'Start Task'">
    Click the **Start Task** button to mark it as in progress.

    This:
    - Updates the task status to "In Progress"
    - Notifies relevant stakeholders
    - Starts tracking time (if enabled)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Complete the Work">
    Do the work described in the task.

    Refer back to the task description as needed.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Upload Evidence">
    When finished, upload evidence of completion (documents, screenshots, photos).

    [Learn more about uploading evidence](/workflows/uploading-evidence)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Mark Complete">
    Click **Mark Complete** to finish the task.

    The task moves to "Completed" status and any dependent tasks may become available.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Working with Team Tasks

Some tasks are assigned to your entire team rather than to you specifically. Here's how to handle them:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find Team Tasks">
    Look for tasks with **"Team Task"** badge in the workflow.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Claim the Task">
    Click **Claim Task** to assign it to yourself.

    This removes it from other team members' task lists and makes you responsible for completion.

    <Tip>
    Claiming tasks prevents duplicate work and ensures clear ownership.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Complete as Normal">
    Once claimed, complete the task like any other task assigned directly to you.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What If You Can't Complete a Task?

Sometimes you can't complete a task as expected. Here's what to do:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Task is Blocked">
    If you encounter an issue that prevents completion:

    1. Click **Mark as Blocked**
    2. Describe the issue in a comment
    3. Tag relevant people who can help
    4. The task status changes to "Blocked"
    5. Workflow owner is notified

    **Example**: "Cannot complete - vendor hasn't responded to contract request. Tagged @sarah for follow-up."
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Task Needs Clarification">
    If task instructions are unclear:

    1. Click **Add Comment**
    2. Ask your question
    3. Tag the workflow owner or admin
    4. Wait for response before proceeding

    **Example**: "@admin The task says 'configure system settings' but doesn't specify which settings. Can you clarify?"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Task Assigned Incorrectly">
    If you receive a task that shouldn't be assigned to you:

    1. Click **Request Reassignment**
    2. Explain why it's not yours
    3. Suggest who should own it
    4. Admin will reassign

    **Example**: "This task requires Finance approval, which I don't have authority for. Should be assigned to @finance-director."
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Task Can't Be Done Yet">
    If you realize a task is missing dependencies:

    1. Add a comment explaining the issue
    2. Tag the workflow admin
    3. Continue with other available tasks

    **Example**: "Can't schedule orientation until equipment arrives (Task 5). That task isn't complete yet."
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices for Starting Workflows

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Review Before Starting">
    Always review the entire workflow before starting tasks. Understanding the big picture helps you:
    - Prioritize effectively
    - Anticipate upcoming tasks
    - Prepare resources you'll need
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Start with Available Tasks">
    Don't skip available tasks to work on future tasks. Dependencies exist for a reason - they ensure work happens in the right order.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Communicate Blockers Early">
    If you see potential blockers, raise them immediately. Don't wait until you're actually stuck.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Update Progress Regularly">
    Mark tasks complete as soon as you finish them. This:
    - Keeps the team informed
    - Unlocks dependent tasks
    - Maintains accurate timeline projections
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Upload Evidence Immediately">
    Don't batch evidence uploads. Upload as you complete each task to avoid forgetting details.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Tips for Managing Multiple Workflows

If you're working on several workflows simultaneously:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Prioritize by Due Date" icon="calendar">
    Work on workflows with nearest due dates first
  </Card>

  <Card title="Batch Similar Tasks" icon="layer-group">
    If you have similar tasks across workflows, do them together
  </Card>

  <Card title="Block Focus Time" icon="clock">
    Set aside dedicated time for workflow tasks to avoid context switching
  </Card>

  <Card title="Use Dashboard View" icon="table-columns">
    View all your tasks across all workflows in one consolidated list
  </Card>
</CardGroup>
