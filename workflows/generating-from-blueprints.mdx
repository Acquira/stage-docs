## What Are Blueprints?

Blueprints are high-level business process frameworks that define how your organization operates. They describe:

- Major process categories (e.g., Acquisition, Operations, HR)
- Key process areas within each category
- Relationships between processes
- Inputs, outputs, and stakeholders

Think of blueprints as the 30,000-foot view of your business processes, while guides are the detailed step-by-step instructions.

    **Placeholder**: Screenshot showing the button location
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select a Blueprint">
    Choose the business process blueprint you want to convert:

    - **Acquisition Process Blueprint**
    - **Operations Management Blueprint**
    - **HR & People Management Blueprint**
    - **Financial Management Blueprint**
    - Custom blueprints your organization has created

    <Frame>

    </Frame>

    <Note>
    **Placeholder**: Screenshot of blueprint selection screen
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose Process Category">
    Blueprints contain multiple process categories. Select which category to generate workflows for:

    **Example - Acquisition Blueprint:**
    - Pre-Acquisition Analysis
    - Due Diligence
    - Closing & Transition
    - Post-Acquisition Integration

    You can select one or multiple categories.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Generation Settings">
    Set preferences for workflow generation:

    - **Task Detail Level**: Summary tasks vs. detailed tasks
    - **Include Sub-Processes**: Generate workflows for sub-processes too
    - **Auto-Assign Stakeholders**: Assign tasks based on blueprint stakeholder roles
    - **Link Related Workflows**: Create dependencies between related workflows

    <Info>
    Blueprint generation creates broader workflows than guide generation. Expect to refine and add detail after generation.
    </Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review Generated Workflow Structure">
    AI shows you a preview of what will be created:

    - Main workflow name
    - Number of tasks
    - Sub-workflows (if applicable)
    - Key stakeholders
    - Major milestones

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/workflows/blueprint-preview.png" alt="Blueprint-generated workflow preview" />
    </Frame>

    <Note>
    **Placeholder**: Screenshot showing preview of generated workflows
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Customize Workflows">
    Review and edit the generated workflows:

    - Add missing tasks
    - Break down high-level tasks into subtasks
    - Define task dependencies
    - Assign to specific roles in your organization
    - Set estimated durations
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save Workflow Templates">
    Save the generated workflows as templates in your library.

    Each category-level workflow becomes a separate template you can use to create instances.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Use Cases for Blueprint Generation

### Use Case 1: New Acquisition Process

<Accordion title="Scenario">
  Your company has acquired a new business. You need comprehensive workflows to manage the entire acquisition process from due diligence through integration.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Solution">
  Generate workflows from the Acquisition Blueprint:

  1. Select "Acquisition Process Blueprint"
  2. Generate workflows for all categories (Due Diligence, Closing, Integration)
  3. Customize with company-specific details
  4. Create a workflow instance for the new acquisition
  5. Assign to acquisition team
</Accordion>

### Use Case 2: Standardizing Operations

<Accordion title="Scenario">
  You're standardizing operations across multiple business locations. You need consistent operational workflows for inventory, quality control, customer service, etc.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Solution">
  Generate workflows from the Operations Blueprint:

  1. Select "Operations Management Blueprint"
  2. Choose relevant categories (Inventory, Quality, Service)
  3. Customize for your industry and operations
  4. Deploy the same workflows across all locations
</Accordion>

### Use Case 3: Building HR Infrastructure

<Accordion title="Scenario">
  You're scaling your team and need structured workflows for hiring, onboarding, training, and performance management.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Solution">
  Generate workflows from the HR Blueprint:

  1. Select "HR & People Management Blueprint"
  2. Generate workflows for Recruitment, Onboarding, Development
  3. Customize for your company culture and policies
  4. Create instances for each new hire or review cycle
</Accordion>

## Category-Level Workflows

Blueprint generation creates category-level workflows, which are broader than procedure-level workflows:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/workflows/category-vs-procedure.png" alt="Category vs Procedure Workflows" />
</Frame>

<Note>
**Placeholder**: Visual diagram comparing category-level and procedure-level workflows
</Note>

### Category-Level: Acquisition Due Diligence

- **Scope**: Entire due diligence process
- **Tasks**: 15-25 high-level tasks covering financial review, legal review, operational assessment, etc.
- **Duration**: 30-90 days
- **Stakeholders**: Multiple teams (finance, legal, operations, HR)

### Procedure-Level: Financial Statement Review

- **Scope**: Just the financial statement review portion
- **Tasks**: 8-12 detailed tasks for analyzing financial statements
- **Duration**: 3-7 days
- **Stakeholders**: Finance team only

<Tip>
Category-level workflows are great for managing major initiatives. Procedure-level workflows (generated from guides) are better for specific, repeatable tasks.
</Tip>

## Refining Blueprint-Generated Workflows

Blueprint generation gives you a starting framework. You'll need to refine it:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add Detail to Tasks">
    Blueprint tasks are high-level. Break them down into specific, actionable subtasks.

    **Example:**
    - **Blueprint Task**: "Conduct financial due diligence"
    - **Refined Tasks**:
      - Review 3 years of financial statements
      - Analyze revenue trends and patterns
      - Verify accounts receivable aging
      - Assess debt structure and obligations
      - Identify financial risks and opportunities
  </Step>

  <Step title="Define Dependencies">
    Blueprint generation suggests dependencies but can't know all your specific sequencing requirements.

    Carefully review and adjust task dependencies to match your actual process flow.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Assign to Your Org Structure">
    Blueprint uses generic roles (e.g., "Finance Manager"). Update these to match your organization:

    - Generic: "Finance Manager"
    - Your Org: "Sarah Chen - Director of FP&A"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Realistic Durations">
    Add estimated durations to tasks based on your team's capacity and the scope of work.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Evidence Requirements">
    Specify what evidence should be uploaded for each task to ensure accountability.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test and Iterate">
    Create a test instance and run through it with your team. Gather feedback and refine the template.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Linking Related Workflows

Blueprint generation can create dependencies between related workflows:

**Example: Acquisition Process**

```
Workflow: Pre-Acquisition Analysis
  ↓ (Must complete before starting)
Workflow: Due Diligence
  ↓ (Must complete before starting)
Workflow: Closing & Transition
  ↓ (Must complete before starting)
Workflow: Post-Acquisition Integration
```

<Info>
When you enable "Link Related Workflows," the system ensures workflows are completed in sequence. You can't start Due Diligence until Pre-Acquisition Analysis is complete.
</Info>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start Broad, Then Narrow">
    Generate the broad category-level workflow first. Then create more detailed procedure-level workflows for complex tasks within it.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Involve Process Owners">
    Blueprint generation creates a framework, but process owners know the details. Involve them in refining the workflow.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Don't Over-Customize Initially">
    Get the workflow working with basic customization first. Add advanced features and details after you've run it a few times.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Version Your Blueprints">
    As your processes evolve, update your blueprints. Regenerate workflows periodically to stay aligned.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use for Strategic Processes">
    Blueprint generation works best for strategic, high-level processes (acquisitions, major projects, annual cycles). Use guide generation for tactical, operational tasks.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Blueprint Generation vs Manual Creation

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Use Blueprint Generation When" icon="wand-magic-sparkles">
    - You have a documented business process framework
    - You need multiple related workflows
    - You want to ensure strategic alignment
    - You're setting up processes for the first time
  </Card>

  <Card title="Use Manual Creation When" icon="pen">
    - You have a unique, one-off process
    - The workflow is very simple (3-5 tasks)
    - You need complete control over every detail
    - No blueprint exists for your process
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Common Challenges

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Generated Workflows Are Too Generic">
    **Solution**: This is expected. Blueprint workflows are intentionally high-level. Your job is to add the specific details for your organization.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Too Many Tasks Created">
    **Solution**: Consolidate related tasks or use sub-workflows. Break large workflows into smaller, more manageable pieces.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Unclear Task Assignments">
    **Solution**: Blueprints use generic roles. You must map these to your actual organizational roles and people.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Missing Process Details">
    **Solution**: Combine blueprint generation (for structure) with guide generation (for details). Generate the framework from the blueprint, then generate specific subtasks from guides.
  </Accordion>
