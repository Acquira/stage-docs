## When to Create Workflows Manually

Manual workflow creation gives you complete control over every detail. Use this approach when:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="No Existing Documentation" icon="file-slash">
    You're creating a workflow for a process that isn't documented yet
  </Card>

  <Card title="Simple Workflows" icon="list">
    The workflow has only a few tasks and AI generation would be overkill
  </Card>

  <Card title="Unique Processes" icon="sparkles">
    The process is highly specific to your organization and wouldn't match any template
  </Card>

  <Card title="Maximum Control" icon="sliders">
    You want precise control over every task, dependency, and assignment
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Creating a Workflow Template

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Workflow Templates">
    Go to **Settings** > **Workflow Templates** in the main navigation.

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/workflows/workflow-templates-nav.png" alt="Navigation to Workflow Templates" />
    </Frame>

    <Note>
    **Placeholder**: Screenshot showing navigation path
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click 'Create New Template'">
    Click the **Create New Template** button in the top right corner.

    This opens the workflow template builder.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Name Your Workflow">
    Enter a clear, descriptive name for your workflow template:

    - **Good**: "Employee Onboarding - Full-Time Employees"
    - **Bad**: "Onboarding" or "Workflow 1"

    Add a description that explains when this workflow should be used.

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/workflows/name-workflow.png" alt="Workflow naming screen" />
    </Frame>

    <Note>
    **Placeholder**: Screenshot of workflow name and description fields
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Workflow Category">
    Assign the workflow to a category to help organize your template library:

    - HR & People
    - Operations
    - Finance
    - Acquisition
    - Custom categories
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Tasks">
    Start adding tasks to your workflow (detailed in next section).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Define Task Order">
    Arrange tasks in the order they should appear in the workflow.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Task Dependencies">
    Define which tasks must be completed before others can start.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Default Assignments">
    Assign tasks to roles or specific people.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save Template">
    Click **Save Template** to add it to your template library.

    The template is now ready to use for creating workflow instances.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Adding Tasks to Your Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click 'Add Task'">
    In the workflow builder, click the **Add Task** button.

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/workflows/add-task-button.png" alt="Add Task button" />
    </Frame>

    <Note>
    **Placeholder**: Screenshot showing Add Task button in workflow builder
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter Task Name">
    Give the task a clear, action-oriented name:

    - **Good**: "Send offer letter to candidate"
    - **Bad**: "Offer letter" or "Step 3"

    Use action verbs: Send, Review, Create, Schedule, Complete, Upload, Verify, etc.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Write Task Description">
    Provide detailed instructions for completing the task:

    **Example:**
    ```
    Send the formal offer letter to the candidate via email.

    Include:
    - Salary and benefits summary
    - Start date
    - Reporting manager
    - Link to employee handbook

    Use the "Offer Letter Template" in the HR shared drive.
    ```

    <Tip>
    Write descriptions as if you're explaining the task to someone doing it for the first time. Include what, why, and how.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Task Priority">
    Choose the priority level:

    - **High**: Critical tasks that must be done first or are time-sensitive
    - **Medium**: Important tasks with moderate urgency (default)
    - **Low**: Tasks that are helpful but not urgent
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Estimated Duration">
    How long should this task take to complete?

    - 15 minutes
    - 1 hour
    - 2 days
    - 1 week

    This helps with workflow timeline planning.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Assign to Role or Person">
    Who should complete this task?

    - **Role**: "HR Manager", "Operations Lead", "Finance Director"
    - **Specific Person**: "Sarah Chen", "John Smith"
    - **Department**: "HR Team", "Operations"

    <Info>
    Using roles instead of specific people makes templates more flexible. You can override assignments when creating instances.
    </Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Specify Evidence Requirements">
    What evidence should be uploaded to prove task completion?

    - Screenshot of email sent
    - Signed document (PDF)
    - Completed form
    - Photo of setup
    - Confirmation number

    Be specific about what evidence is needed.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save Task">
    Click **Save Task** to add it to the workflow.

    Repeat this process to add all tasks to your workflow.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Setting Task Order

Tasks appear in your workflow in the order you create them, but you can reorder them:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Drag and Drop" icon="arrows-up-down">
    Click and drag tasks to reorder them in the list
  </Card>

  <Card title="Use Order Numbers" icon="hashtag">
    Manually set task numbers (1, 2, 3, etc.) to define order
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/workflows/reorder-tasks.png" alt="Reordering tasks interface" />
</Frame>

<Note>
**Placeholder**: Screenshot showing drag-and-drop task reordering
</Note>

<Info>
Task order is different from dependencies. Order is how tasks appear in the list. Dependencies control when tasks can actually be started.
</Info>

## Defining Task Dependencies

Dependencies control the workflow's logic - which tasks must finish before others can start.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select a Task">
    Click on the task you want to add dependencies to.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click 'Add Dependency'">
    In the task detail panel, click **Add Dependency**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose Dependent Tasks">
    Select which task(s) must be completed before this task can start:

    **Example:**
    - Task: "Schedule first day orientation"
    - Depends on: "Receive signed offer letter" AND "Create email account"

    This task won't become available until both dependencies are complete.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Dependency Type">
    Choose how dependencies work:

    - **All Must Complete** (AND): All selected tasks must finish
    - **Any Can Complete** (OR): Only one selected task must finish

    Most workflows use "All Must Complete."
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save Dependencies">
    Click **Save** to apply the dependencies to the task.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Dependency Examples

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Simple Linear Dependency">
    ```
    Task 1: Send contract
      ↓
    Task 2: Receive signed contract (depends on Task 1)
      ↓
    Task 3: Process payment (depends on Task 2)
    ```

    Each task depends on the one before it. Classic sequential workflow.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Parallel Dependencies">
    ```
    Task 1: Offer accepted
      ↓
    Task 2: Order laptop (depends on Task 1)
    Task 3: Create email account (depends on Task 1)
      ↓
    Task 4: Send welcome email (depends on Tasks 2 & 3)
    ```

    Tasks 2 and 3 can happen simultaneously after Task 1. Task 4 waits for both.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="OR Dependencies">
    ```
    Task 1: Get approval from Director OR VP
    Task 2A: Director approves
    Task 2B: VP approves
      ↓
    Task 3: Proceed with project (depends on 2A OR 2B)
    ```

    Task 3 can start when either Task 2A or Task 2B completes. Useful for approval workflows.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Warning>
Avoid circular dependencies! Task A can't depend on Task B if Task B depends on Task A. The system will prevent you from creating these.
</Warning>

## Setting Default Assignments

Assign tasks to roles or people who typically handle them:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Role-Based (Recommended)" icon="user-group">
    - Flexible across team changes
    - Works for multiple instances
    - Example: "HR Manager", "Operations Lead"
  </Card>

  <Card title="Person-Based" icon="user">
    - Used for very specific responsibilities
    - Must update if person changes roles
    - Example: "Sarah Chen", "John Smith"
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
Use role-based assignments in templates. You can always override with specific people when creating a workflow instance.
</Tip>

## Workflow Template Settings

Configure additional template settings:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Template Visibility">
    Control who can see and use this template:

    - **Everyone**: All users can create instances
    - **Admins Only**: Only admins can use this template
    - **Specific Teams**: Only certain departments or teams
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Auto-Start Rules">
    Define when workflow instances should be automatically created:

    - When a new employee is hired
    - When a new acquisition begins
    - On specific dates (quarterly reviews, annual audits)
    - When certain conditions are met
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Notification Settings">
    Configure how users are notified about tasks:

    - Email notifications when tasks become available
    - Reminders before due dates
    - Alerts when workflows are blocked
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Approval Requirements">
    Require manager approval before tasks are marked complete:

    - All tasks require approval
    - Only high-priority tasks
    - Specific critical tasks
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Testing Your Workflow

Before deploying a workflow template, test it:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Test Instance">
    From the template, click **Create Test Instance**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Assign to Yourself">
    Assign all tasks to yourself for testing.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Walk Through Each Task">
    Complete each task as if you were doing it for real:

    - Are instructions clear?
    - Do dependencies work correctly?
    - Can you complete tasks in the right order?
    - Are evidence requirements reasonable?
  </Step>

  <Step title="Check for Issues">
    Look for:

    - Confusing task descriptions
    - Missing dependencies
    - Tasks that should be combined or split
    - Incorrect assignments
  </Step>

  <Step title="Refine Template">
    Go back to the template and make improvements based on your test.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test Again">
    Create another test instance and verify your changes fixed the issues.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start Simple">
    Create a basic workflow first with core tasks only. Add complexity (dependencies, detailed descriptions) after you've tested the basic flow.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Clear Task Names">
    Task names should be self-explanatory action items:

    - ✅ "Review financial statements for accuracy"
    - ❌ "Financial review"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Write Detailed Descriptions">
    Include enough information that someone unfamiliar with the process could complete the task:

    - What to do
    - Why it matters
    - How to do it
    - What resources are needed
    - What to deliver as evidence
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Don't Over-Depend">
    Only create dependencies that are truly required. Over-depending tasks makes workflows inflexible and hard to manage.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Involve Process Owners">
    Get input from people who actually do the work. They'll know details you might miss.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Version Your Templates">
    When making significant changes, create a new version rather than editing the active template. This preserves historical workflows.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

<Warning>
**Too Many Dependencies**: Creating dependencies for every single task makes the workflow rigid. Only depend tasks when truly necessary.
</Warning>

<Warning>
**Vague Task Descriptions**: "Complete onboarding" isn't helpful. "Send new hire paperwork packet via DocuSign and confirm receipt" is clear and actionable.
</Warning>

<Warning>
**Overly Granular Tasks**: Breaking "Send email" into 10 micro-tasks creates busywork. Find the right balance of task granularity.
</Warning>

<Warning>
**Forgetting Evidence**: If you don't specify evidence requirements, tasks will be marked complete without proof. Be explicit about what evidence is needed.
</Warning>
