  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Viewing Workflow Progress

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Workflow">
    Navigate to **My Workflows** and click on the workflow you want to track.

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/workflows/workflow-overview-progress.png" alt="Workflow overview with progress" />
    </Frame>

    <Note>
    **Placeholder**: Screenshot of workflow overview showing progress indicators
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="View Progress Dashboard">
    The workflow overview shows several progress indicators at the top:

    - Overall completion percentage
    - Visual progress bar
    - Task completion count
    - Estimated completion date
    - Status badges
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review Detailed Task List">
    Scroll down to see all tasks with their individual statuses:

    - Completed tasks (green checkmark)
    - In progress tasks (blue spinner)
    - Available tasks (green play button)
    - Pending tasks (gray clock)
    - Blocked tasks (red warning)
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Progress Indicators Explained

### Overall Completion Percentage

<Card title="Task Completion %" icon="percent">
  Shows what percentage of all tasks are complete

  **Example**: "12 of 20 tasks complete - 60%"
</Card>

This is the simplest way to see how far along the workflow is.

<Info>
Percentage is calculated based on **number of tasks**, not time or effort. A 5-minute task counts the same as a 5-hour task.
</Info>

### Visual Progress Bar

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/workflows/progress-bar.png" alt="Workflow progress bar" />
</Frame>

<Note>
**Placeholder**: Screenshot of progress bar with color segments
</Note>

The progress bar shows completion status visually:

- **Green segment**: Completed tasks
- **Blue segment**: In progress tasks
- **Gray segment**: Not yet started tasks

Hover over the bar to see exact numbers for each status.

### Task Breakdown

<Card title="Task Status Count" icon="chart-pie">
  Shows how many tasks are in each status:

  - 8 Completed
  - 2 In Progress
  - 3 Available
  - 5 Pending
  - 2 Blocked
</Card>

This gives you a detailed view of where tasks are in their lifecycle.

### Estimated Completion Date

<Card title="Projected Finish Date" icon="calendar-clock">
  Based on current progress and remaining tasks:

  **Example**: "Estimated completion: June 15, 2025"
</Card>

<Accordion title="How is this calculated?">
  The system considers:
  - Task completion rate (how fast tasks are being finished)
  - Remaining tasks and their estimated durations
  - Task dependencies and critical path
  - Historical completion times for similar workflows

  <Warning>
  This is an estimate, not a guarantee. Blocked tasks, delays, and changing priorities can affect actual completion date.
  </Warning>
</Accordion>

## Task Status Meanings

Understanding task statuses helps you interpret progress:

### Completed

<Accordion title="Task is Finished">
  âœ… **Green with Checkmark**

  - Work is done
  - Evidence is uploaded
  - Task is marked complete
  - No further action needed

  Completed tasks show:
  - Who completed it
  - When it was completed
  - Time taken to complete
  - Uploaded evidence
</Accordion>

### In Progress

<Accordion title="Someone is Actively Working">
  ðŸ”µ **Blue with Spinner**

  - Task has been started
  - Assigned person is working on it
  - Work is underway but not finished

  In Progress tasks show:
  - Who is working on it
  - When they started
  - Time elapsed since starting
</Accordion>

### Available

<Accordion title="Ready to Be Started">
  ðŸŸ¢ **Green with Play Button**

  - All dependencies are met
  - Assigned person can start anytime
  - No blockers

  Available tasks are your action items - these are what you should work on next.
</Accordion>

### Pending

<Accordion title="Waiting on Dependencies">
  âšª **Gray with Clock**

  - Task exists but can't start yet
  - Dependencies aren't complete
  - Will become Available once dependencies finish

  Pending tasks show which other tasks must complete first.
</Accordion>

### Blocked

<Accordion title="Cannot Proceed Due to Issue">
  ðŸ”´ **Red with Warning Icon**

  - Task cannot be completed due to a problem
  - Needs intervention to unblock
  - Someone has flagged an issue

  Blocked tasks show:
  - Why it's blocked
  - Who blocked it
  - What's needed to unblock it
</Accordion>

## Progress by Phase or Section

Many workflows organize tasks into phases or sections:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/workflows/progress-by-phase.png" alt="Progress broken down by phase" />
</Frame>

<Note>
**Placeholder**: Screenshot showing workflow phases with individual progress bars
</Note>

### Example: Employee Onboarding Phases

```
Phase 1: Pre-Onboarding (100% complete)
  â”œâ”€ âœ“ Send offer letter
  â”œâ”€ âœ“ Receive signed offer
  â””â”€ âœ“ Order equipment

Phase 2: First Day Setup (66% complete)
  â”œâ”€ âœ“ Create email account
  â”œâ”€ âœ“ Set up workstation
  â””â”€ â§— Assign security badge [IN PROGRESS]

Phase 3: Week 1 Training (0% complete)
  â”œâ”€ âŠ— Schedule orientation [AVAILABLE]
  â”œâ”€ âŠ™ Complete HR paperwork [PENDING]
  â””â”€ âŠ™ Assign training modules [PENDING]
```

This view helps you see:
- Which phases are complete
- Where you currently are in the process
- What's coming next

## Identifying Blocked Tasks

Blocked tasks prevent workflow progress. Identify and resolve them quickly:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Look for Red Warning Icons">
    Scan your task list for red blocked indicators.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click the Blocked Task">
    Open it to see details about why it's blocked.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Read the Block Reason">
    Someone will have added a comment explaining the issue:

    **Examples:**
    - "Vendor hasn't responded to contract request - 3 days overdue"
    - "Cannot proceed without budget approval from Finance Director"
    - "Equipment delayed - new delivery date TBD"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Check Who Can Unblock">
    The block comment usually indicates:
    - What's needed to unblock
    - Who needs to take action
    - Any relevant people tagged
  </Step>

  <Step title="Take Action or Escalate">
    - If you can unblock it: Take action
    - If someone else must unblock: Follow up with them
    - If urgent: Escalate to workflow owner or manager
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
Blocked tasks often create a domino effect. If Task 5 is blocked, all tasks that depend on Task 5 are also blocked indirectly. Address blocks quickly to prevent workflow stalls.
</Warning>

## Understanding the Critical Path

The critical path is the sequence of tasks that determines the minimum time to complete the workflow.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/workflows/critical-path.png" alt="Critical path highlighted in workflow" />
</Frame>

<Note>
**Placeholder**: Diagram showing critical path through workflow with parallel tasks
</Note>

### Why Critical Path Matters

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Determines Timeline">
    Workflow cannot complete faster than the critical path. If the critical path takes 30 days, the workflow takes at least 30 days.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Shows Priority Tasks">
    Tasks on the critical path should be prioritized. Delays here delay the entire workflow.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Reveals Flexibility">
    Tasks NOT on critical path have slack time. They can be delayed without affecting overall completion.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
Some systems highlight critical path tasks in red or orange. Focus on completing these first to keep the workflow on schedule.
</Tip>

## Tracking Your Personal Progress

View all your tasks across all workflows in one place:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to My Tasks">
    Click **My Tasks** in the main navigation.

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/workflows/my-tasks-dashboard.png" alt="My Tasks dashboard view" />
    </Frame>

    <Note>
    **Placeholder**: Screenshot of My Tasks consolidated view
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="View All Your Tasks">
    See every task assigned to you across all workflows:

    - Active tasks you're working on
    - Available tasks ready to start
    - Completed tasks (for reference)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Sort by Priority">
    Sort tasks to see what needs attention first:

    - **By Due Date**: Most urgent first
    - **By Priority**: High priority first
    - **By Workflow**: Grouped by workflow
    - **By Status**: Available first, then in progress
  </Step>

  <Step title="Filter Your View">
    Filter to focus on specific tasks:

    - Tasks due this week
    - High priority only
    - Specific workflow
    - Specific category (HR, Finance, etc.)
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Progress Reports and Analytics

Many systems provide progress reports for workflows:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Workflow Summary" icon="file-chart-column">
    Overall completion, timeline, and health metrics
  </Card>

  <Card title="Team Performance" icon="users-viewfinder">
    How quickly team members complete tasks
  </Card>

  <Card title="Bottleneck Analysis" icon="funnel">
    Which tasks consistently take longer than expected
  </Card>

  <Card title="Completion Trends" icon="chart-line">
    Progress over time compared to expected trajectory
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/workflows/progress-report.png" alt="Workflow progress report" />
</Frame>

<Note>
**Placeholder**: Screenshot of progress report with charts and metrics
</Note>

### Using Reports Effectively

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Identify Patterns">
    Look for tasks that:
    - Consistently take longer than estimated
    - Frequently get blocked
    - Often lack evidence
    - Show confusion in comments

    These indicate areas for process improvement.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Compare to Baseline">
    If you've run this workflow before:
    - Compare current progress to previous runs
    - Identify if you're on track, ahead, or behind
    - Understand what's different this time
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Forecast Completion">
    Use progress data to forecast:
    - Realistic completion date
    - Resources needed
    - Potential risks
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Share with Stakeholders">
    Export reports to share with:
    - Leadership (high-level summary)
    - Project managers (detailed metrics)
    - Team members (individual performance)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Workflow Health Indicators

Beyond simple percentage complete, look at workflow health:

### On Track

<Card title="Healthy Workflow" icon="circle-check">
  - Progress matches expected timeline
  - No blocked tasks
  - Tasks completing at steady pace
  - All assignees engaged

  **Indicator**: Green status badge
</Card>

### At Risk

<Card title="Concerning Workflow" icon="triangle-exclamation">
  - Progress slower than expected
  - Some blocked tasks
  - Approaching deadline with tasks remaining
  - Some assignees not engaged

  **Indicator**: Yellow/orange status badge
</Card>

### Behind Schedule

<Card title="Troubled Workflow" icon="circle-xmark">
  - Significantly behind expected progress
  - Multiple blocked tasks
  - Deadline passed or imminent
  - Low completion rate

  **Indicator**: Red status badge
</Card>

<Tip>
Address "At Risk" workflows before they become "Behind Schedule." Early intervention prevents crisis management.
</Tip>

## Communicating Progress to Stakeholders

When providing workflow updates to managers or stakeholders:
