## The Task Completion Process

Completing a task involves more than just doing the work. You need to document what you did and provide evidence.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Task">
    Navigate to the task from your workflow or task list and click to open it.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Read Task Details">
    Carefully review what needs to be done.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Mark as In Progress">
    Click **Start Task** to mark it as in progress.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Perform the Work">
    Complete the task as described in the instructions.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Upload Evidence">
    Provide documentation that proves the task was completed.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Comments (Optional)">
    Include any relevant notes or context.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Mark Complete">
    Click **Mark Complete** to finish the task.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Opening a Task

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to the Task">
    You can access tasks from multiple places:

    - **From a Workflow**: Open the workflow and click the task
    - **From My Tasks**: Go to **My Tasks** and click the task
    - **From Notifications**: Click a task notification
  </Step>

  <Step title="View Task Detail Panel">
    The task detail panel opens, showing:

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/workflows/task-detail-panel.png" alt="Task detail panel" />
    </Frame>

    <Note>
    **Placeholder**: Screenshot of task detail panel with all elements labeled
    </Note>

    - Task name and description
    - Priority level
    - Assigned to (you or your team)
    - Status (Available, In Progress, etc.)
    - Dependencies (what must be done first)
    - Evidence requirements
    - Due date
    - Comments and activity history
  </Step>

  <Step title="Check Dependencies">
    Before starting, verify all dependencies are met:

    ✅ **All dependencies complete** - You can start this task

    ⏳ **Waiting on dependencies** - Task shows what's blocking it

    If dependencies aren't met, you can't start the task yet.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Reading Task Details

Carefully read the task description before starting. Look for:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="What to Do" icon="list-check">
    The specific actions you need to take
  </Card>

  <Card title="Why It Matters" icon="lightbulb">
    Context about why this task is important
  </Card>

  <Card title="How to Do It" icon="map">
    Step-by-step instructions or guidance
  </Card>

  <Card title="What to Deliver" icon="file-circle-check">
    Expected output or evidence requirements
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Example: Well-Written Task

**Task Name**: Send Offer Letter to Candidate

**Description**:
```
Send the formal employment offer letter to the candidate via email.

WHY: This formalizes our verbal offer and provides the candidate with
written details about compensation, benefits, and start date.

HOW:
1. Download the offer letter template from the HR shared drive
2. Fill in candidate details (name, role, salary, start date)
3. Have the hiring manager review and approve
4. Send via email with subject: "Employment Offer - [Position]"
5. CC: hr@company.com

WHAT TO DELIVER:
- Screenshot of sent email showing candidate received the offer
- Copy of the signed offer letter (after candidate returns it)

DEADLINE: Must be sent within 24 hours of verbal offer
```

<Tip>
If task instructions are unclear, add a comment asking for clarification before starting. It's better to ask than to do the wrong thing.
</Tip>

## Marking a Task as In Progress

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click 'Start Task'">
    Click the **Start Task** button in the task detail panel.

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/workflows/start-task-button.png" alt="Start Task button" />
    </Frame>

    <Note>
    **Placeholder**: Screenshot highlighting the Start Task button
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Task Status Updates">
    The task status changes from **Available** to **In Progress**.

    This tells your team you're actively working on it.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Notifications Sent">
    Relevant stakeholders are notified that you've started:
    - Workflow owner
    - Team members waiting on this task
    - Your manager (if configured)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Time Tracking Begins">
    If time tracking is enabled, the system starts tracking how long you spend on this task.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
You don't have to click "Start Task" to begin work, but it's a best practice. It provides visibility and prevents duplicate work.
</Info>

## Performing the Work

Now do the actual work described in the task.

### Tips While Working

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Collect Evidence as You Go">
    Don't wait until the end to take screenshots or save documents. Collect evidence throughout the process.

    **Example**: If the task involves sending 5 emails, take a screenshot after each one is sent.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Follow Instructions Exactly">
    Don't improvise or skip steps unless you're sure they're unnecessary. If you think instructions are wrong, ask first.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Document Issues">
    If you encounter problems, make notes about what went wrong and how you resolved it. Add this context when you complete the task.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Refer to Resources">
    Use any referenced templates, guides, or tools mentioned in the task description.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Ask for Help When Stuck">
    If you're blocked or confused for more than 15 minutes, reach out. Add a comment in the task or contact the workflow owner.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Uploading Evidence

After completing the work, you need to provide evidence. This is not optional.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click 'Add Evidence'">
    In the task detail panel, click **Add Evidence** or **Upload Files**.

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/workflows/add-evidence-button.png" alt="Add Evidence button" />
    </Frame>

    <Note>
    **Placeholder**: Screenshot showing Add Evidence button location
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Files to Upload">
    Choose the evidence files from your computer:

    - Documents (PDF, Word, Excel)
    - Screenshots (PNG, JPG)
    - Photos (JPG, PNG)
    - Other files as appropriate

    You can upload multiple files at once.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Wait for Upload">
    Files upload to the system. Don't close the window until upload completes.

    You'll see a progress indicator for each file.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Evidence Description">
    For each uploaded file, add a brief description:

    **Good**: "Screenshot of sent offer email to candidate John Smith - sent May 15, 2025"

    **Bad**: "screenshot.png"

    <Tip>
    Good descriptions make evidence useful for future reference. Imagine someone reviewing this 6 months from now.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify Upload">
    Confirm your evidence files appear in the task with correct descriptions.
  </Step>
</Steps>

[See detailed guide on uploading evidence](/workflows/uploading-evidence)

## Adding Comments to Tasks

    a June 1 start date instead of May 15. Updated offer letter accordingly
    and confirmed with hiring manager @john-manager before sending.
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Tag People (Optional)">
    Use @mentions to notify specific people:

## Moving to the Next Task

<Steps>
  <Step title="View Updated Task List">
    After completing a task, view your updated task list to see what's available next.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Check for Newly Available Tasks">
    Completing your task may have unlocked tasks that were waiting on it:

    - Look for green **Available** status
    - Check if you're assigned to newly unlocked tasks
  </Step>

  <Step title="Prioritize Next Task">
    Decide what to work on next based on:

    - Task priority (High → Medium → Low)

    - Your availability and skills
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start Next Task">
    Click the next task and begin the completion process again.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
After completing a task, take a moment to see if your completion unlocked tasks for teammates. If so, consider notifying them directly that they can proceed.
</Tip>

## Common Scenarios

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What if I realize I made a mistake after marking complete?">
    **Solution:**

    1. Add a comment to the completed task explaining the error
    2. Contact the workflow owner or admin
    3. They can reopen the task for you to fix
    4. Make corrections and re-upload evidence
    5. Mark complete again

    <Warning>
    Don't try to hide mistakes. It's better to fix them properly than to leave incorrect work in the system.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I mark a task complete without evidence?">
    **Answer**: It depends on the task configuration.

    - Some tasks allow completion without evidence
    - Most tasks require evidence before completion
    - System will prevent completion if evidence is mandatory

    **Best Practice**: Always upload evidence even if optional. Future you (or your teammates) will appreciate it.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if the task requires approval?">
    **Process**:

    1. Complete the work
    2. Upload evidence
    3. Click **Submit for Approval**
    4. Task goes to "Pending Approval" status
    5. Approver reviews your work
    6. If approved: Task moves to Complete
    7. If rejected: Task returns to you with feedback

    You'll be notified of the approval decision.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Task says it's complete but I didn't finish it">
    **Possible Causes**:

    - Teammate completed a team-assigned task
    - Admin manually marked it complete
    - System error

    **Solution**: Add a comment explaining it's not actually complete and tag the workflow owner.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I work on multiple tasks simultaneously?">
    **Answer**: Yes, but not recommended.

    - You can mark multiple tasks "In Progress"
    - But focus on one at a time for better quality
    - Finish one task fully before moving to the next

    **Exception**: When waiting for external input (e.g., vendor response), you can start another task in the meantime.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Task Completion Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Complete Tasks Promptly">
    Don't let tasks sit in "In Progress" for days unless necessary. Complete them quickly to:
    - Unblock dependent tasks
    - Maintain workflow momentum
    - Keep timelines accurate
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Quality Over Speed">
    It's better to take extra time to do a task correctly than to rush and create problems later.

    Poor quality work creates:
    - Rework for you
    - Delays for others
    - Erosion of team trust
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Be Thorough with Evidence">
    Upload clear, complete evidence. Blurry screenshots or partial documents aren't helpful.

    Take 30 extra seconds to get good evidence rather than having to redo it later.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Communicate Proactively">
    Use comments to share:
    - Problems you encountered
    - Decisions you made
    - Information teammates will need

    Over-communication is better than under-communication in workflows.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Update Status Accurately">
    - Don't mark tasks complete if they're only 90% done
    - Don't leave tasks "In Progress" if you've finished them
    - Keep status current so the team has accurate information
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
